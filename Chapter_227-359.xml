<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That to Governor P. H.

<salute>An Act to create a more efficient road system for the county of Collin, in the State of Texas, and making county commissioners ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />officio road commissioners and prescribing their duties as such, and providing for their compensation as Road Commissioners, and defining the powers and duties of the Commissioners Court of said county.</salute>
</opener>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That each member of the commissioners court of Collin county shall be ex-officio road commissioner of their respective districts and under the direction of the commissioners court, shall have charge of all the teams, tools and machinery belonging to the county, and placed in their hands<pb n="246" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="18" /><fw type="header" place="top">Special Laws of Texas.</fw>by said courts; and it shall be their duty, under such rules and regulations as the commissioners court may prescribe, to superintend the laying out of new roads, the making or changing of roads, and the building of bridges. Each of said Com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioners shall, before entering upon the duties of their office, execute a bond of one thousand dollars with two or more good and sufficient sureties, payable to the county judge of said county for the use and benefit of the road and bridge fund, conditioned that they will perform all the duties required of them by law or by the commissioners court, and that they will account for all money or property belonging to the county that may come into their possession.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. The commissioners court of said county shall have full power and au<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />thority, and it shall be their duty to adopt such system for working, laying out, draining and repairing the public roads in said county as they may deem best, and from time to time said court, may change its plans or system of working. Said commissioners court shall have power to purchase such teams, tools and machinery as may be necessary for the working of its roads. Said court shall have power to construct, grade, gravel, or otherwise improve any road or bridge by contract; in such case, said court or the County Judge may advertise in such manner as said court may determine for bids to do such work, and the contract shall be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder, who shall enter into bond payable to the County Judge of said county, for the use of the road and bridge fund, with good and suf<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ficient sureties to be approved by said court, and in such sum as said court may determine, for the faithful compliance with the terms of said contract; but said court shall have the right to reject any and all bids. At the time of making any such contract, the court shall direct the county Treasurer to pass the amount to a particular fund for that purpose, and the Treasurer shall keep a separate account of such fund and the same shall not be used for any other purpose, and can only be paid out on the order of said court, and the said court shall have authority to employ any hands or teams to work on the roads under such regulations and for such price as they may deem best.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. The commissioners court of said county shall require all county con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />victs not otherwise employed to labor upon the public roads under such regula<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions as it may prescribe, and each convict so worked shall receive a credit of fifty cents on his fine first, and then on the cost, for each day he may labor. The commissioners court may at a regular term allow to the officers and wit<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nesses such amount of their cost for the arrest and conviction of said convicts as it may deem best: provided that it shall not allow to any officer an amount greater than the following: County Judge, $3.00; County Attorney, $5.00, in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cluding commissions: County Clerks and Justices of the Peace, $1.70; Sheriffs or Constables, $2.00; which amount shall be paid to the officers out of the road and bridge fund, on the warrant of the County Judge, when said fine and costs shall have been worked out as provided in this section; provided, that this shall not be so construed as to relieve any convict from the payment of all cost for which he would be liable under the general laws of this State. The commissioners court may grant a reasonable commutation of time for which a convict is committed as a reward for faithful services and good behavior. Provided, that such com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mutation shall in no case exceed one-tenth of the whole time. The commission<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ers court may provide the necessary houses, prisons, clothing, bedding, food,<pb n="247" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="19" /><fw type="header" place="top">Special Laws of Texas.</fw>medicine, medical attention and guards for the safe and humane keeping of the convicts.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. Each county commissioner shall have control of all road overseers in his district and shall deliver to each of them all teams, tools and machinery necessary in working the roads in the district of said overseer, so far as he has been supplied therewith by the commissioners court, taking the receipt of said road overseer therefor, specifying each item and giving its value, which receipt shall be a full answer of the liability of the Commissioner and shall fix the liability of the overseer; and any commissioner or overseer who shall have been entrusted with any teams, tools or machinery, belonging to said county, shall be liable for any damages that may occur to the same while in his possession. It shall be the duty of the road overseer when he has finished the work on his road to return to said Commissioner all teams, tools and machinery received from him and to take up the receipt given therefor.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. It shall be the duty of the county Commissioner when acting as road Commissioner to inform himself of the condition of the public roads in his district, and shall determine what character of work shall be done upon said roads, and shall direct the manner of grading, draining or otherwise improving the same, which directions shall be observed and obeyed by all road overseers of his district.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. The commissioner may require each road overseer in his district to call out the hands in such numbers as may be sufficient to perform the work, but no Toad hand shall be required to work exceeding five days in any one year, unless the term of service as prescribed by the general laws shall be extended beyond that time, and provided that all the road hands in a particular district shall, as Jar as practicable, be worked a uniform time. Each road overseer shall have full control of all road hands within his road district, and he shall see that each hand, when called nut, shall perform a good day&#8217;s work, and if any hand when so called out shall fail or refuse to perform a good days work or to work in the manner the overseer may direct, he shall be liable to the same penalty as if he had failed to appear in obedience to the summons. The commissioners court may allow to any overseer who shall be engaged in the discharge of the duties of his office for more than five days during any one year, a compensation not to exceed one dollar and one-half per day for the time so served.</p>
<p>Sec. 7. Any citizen of Collin county liable for road duty who shall on or before the first day of January of any year pay to the county treasurer the sum of $3.00 shall be exempt from road duty for such year, beginning on the first day of Jan<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />uary. The treasurer shall receive and receipt for all money so paid him and place the same to the credit of the road and bridge fund, and he shall keep a separate account for each road district, of all money so received by him, and the same shall be expended in the district from which it was received. The treasurer shall, on the third day of January, or as soon thereafter as practicable, furnish to each county commissioner, a list of all persons in their respective districts that have paid said sum as provided in this section.</p>
<p>Sec. 8. Whenever it shall be necessary to occupy any lands for the purpose of opening, widening, straightening or draining any road or part thereof, if the owner of such land and the county commissioners court can not agree upon the damage to be paid, the county may proceed to condemn the same in the same manner that a railroad company can con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />demn land for right of way and the same proceedings may be had and<pb n="248" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="20" /><fw type="header" place="top">Special Laws of Texas.</fw>the same rights shall exist to each party as would exist if the proceedings were by a railroad company, except that the county shall in no case be required to give bond.</p>
<p>Sec. 9. Each county commissioner when acting as road commissioner and per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />forming the duties imposed upon him by law or by the commissioners court shall be entitled to two dollars per day for the services actually performed; provided that he shall not receive more than forty-five dollars ($45.00) per quarter when the road and bridge tax has not been levied as provided by law under the amend<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment of 1889, as adopted in 1890 to the Constitution of the State of Texas. And when said tax shall have been levied, he may receive an amount not to exceed ninety ($90.00) dollars per quarter, which amount shall be paid out of the road and bridge fund when the account shall have been approved by the commissioners court, and the court shall not approve said accounts unless the commissioner pre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />senting it shall first sign an oath that the account is just, due and unpaid, and specifying the number of days work actually performed by him, and that it was necessary to be done, and no commissioner shall be entitled to pay as road com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioner while he is performing the duties of county commissioner.</p>
<p>Sec. 10. This act shall be taken notice of by all courts in the same manner as the general law of the State, and it shall be construed to be cumulative of all general laws of the State on the subject of roads and bridges where not in conflict therewith, but in case of a conflict this act shall control as to the said county of Collin.</p>
<p>Sec. 11. The fact that there is now no sufficient road law in force in this State creates an emergency and imperative public necessity, that the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days be suspended, and said rule is hereby suspended, and it is so enacted.</p>

<p>Sec. 2. Subject to the orders and control of the Commissioners court, the road Commissioner shall have charge and control of all such teams, wagons, tools and machinery as the Commissioners court shall place in his custody for use on the public roads of said county and shall execute and deliver to the County Clerk of said county his receipt therefor, specifying each item and its value, which shall be filed by the Clerk of the county court in his office, and a certified copy thereof shall be admissible as evidence in any suit against said Commissioner and his sure<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ties or either of them, on his bond for the said property or the value thereof, the same as the original would be. Said road Commissioner and his sureties shall be responsible on his bond for all such property thus turned over to him until he shall account therefor.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. The road Commissioner shall have control of all road overseers in the county, and shall deliver to each all teams, tools, wagons and machinery necessary in working the roads in the district of such overseers, so far as he has been sup<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />plied therewith by the commissioners court, taking the receipt of said road over<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />seer therefor, specifying each item and giving its value, which receipt shall be a full answer to the liability of the road commissioner for all such teams, wagons, tools and machinery. It shall be the duty of the road overseer, when he has finished the work on his road, to return to said road Commissioner all teams, wagons, tools and machinery received from him and to take up the receipt given for the same.</p>

If any owner of any farm shall fail or refuse after being notified as herein required to trim his hedge as required by this act, then the road overseer shall cause the same to be trimmed in accordance with the provisions of this act, to be paid for out of the road and bridge fund of the county.</p>
<p>Sec. 9. The Commissioners court of said county may make contracts for all supplies and materials to be used in feeding the hands and teams employed on the public roads and in the work of the same, and may make rules and regulations by which the same and all contracts shall be paid by the county, and all persons employed by said court shall be governed by such rules and regulations.

<p>Sec. 10. Whenever it shall be necessary to occupy any lands, for the purpose of opening, widening, straightening or draining any road, or any part thereof, if the owner of such land and the county can not agree upon the damages to be paid, the county may proceed to condemn the same in the same manner that a railroad company can condemn lands for right of way, and the same proceedings shall be had and the same rights shall exist as to each party as would exist if the proceed<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ings were by a railroad company, except that the county shall not be required in any case to give bond.</p>
<p>Sec. 11. This act shall be taken notice of by all courts in the same manner as a general law of the state, and it shall be construed to be cumulative of all gen<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />eral laws of the state on the subject of roads and bridges where not in conflict therewith; but in case of such conflict this act shall control as to the said counties of Grayson, Dallas, Galveston, Brown, Comanche, Mills, Fannin, Travis, Hunt, Hill, Kaufman and Fayette.

The Commissioners court of each of the counties named in this act shall have the right to exercise all the authority land powers herein given, and neither of said counties shall be compelled to employ a road Commissioner, unless the Commissioners court of such county shall deem it advisable so to do; pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided, that the Commissioners court of either of the aforesaid counties shall ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />point a road Commissioner as herein provided for, then the county Commissioners of the county, making said appointment shall not be required to perform the duties required of them by article 4390a, of the Revised Civil Statutes of the State.</p>

<p>1st. To try, hear, determine and punish all misdemeanors which may be com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mitted in the limits of the city of Waco, except as hereinafter provided.</p>
<p>2nd. To try, hear, determine and punish all offenses arising under the pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />visions of this charter.</p>
<p>3rd.

<p>Sec. 2. Be it further enacted that the following additional section be and the same is hereby added to said act, and shall hereafter constitute a part of the same.</p>
<p>Section 21. A. In addition to the powers granted to the said city of Waco, in the preceding section, said city shall have power to devote so much of the revenue of the city arising from taxation, loans, or any other source as may in the judg<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment of the city council be necessary for the erection of public school buildings and hospitals, the purchase and improvement of public works, the construction and repair of storm water sewers and sanitary sewers and the erection and main<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tenance of waterworks, gas works and electric plants; and for the accomplishment of these purposes and the other purposes specified in section 21 of said act, the city of Waco may borrow money upon the credit of the city; and may issue bonds therefor, registered or coupon in such sums and for such amounts as may be found necessary or expedient; said bonds to bear in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />terest at a rate not exceeding eight per cent per annum, but the aggregate amount of bonds issued by the city and outstanding and unpaid, shall<pb n="256" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="28" /><fw type="header" place="top">Special Laws of Texas.</fw>never exceed eight per cent of the taxable values as shown by the assessment rolls.</p>
<p>B. Construction of Sidewalks. Whenever the city council shall by ordinance require and direct the laying and construction of sidewalks on any streets or por<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion of a street within the city, the city secretary shall notify the owners of the property fronting on such street or portion of such street, in writing and under the seal of the city, of the passage of such ordinance and reciting the material prescribed for rise in the construction of such sidewalk, together with the dimen<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sions as prescribed by ordinance; all property owners upon receiving such notice shall comply therewith within not less than sixty days from the receipt of notice; failing in which the mayor shall advertise for bids for the construction of such sidewalks, and shall cause the work to be let out to the lowest and best bidder, who upon the award of the contract, shall construct such sidewalk under the direction of the city engineer. Upon completion of the work, the contractor shall make out and deliver to the mayor an itemized account of the cost of the work including cost of materials, and a description of the lot or lots abutting such side<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />walk, with the names of the owner of such lot or lots, which when receipted and certified to by the mayor under the seal of the city as the original account of said contractor, which had been paid by the city, may be filed and recorded with such certificate in the office of the county clerk of McLennan county, in the books of registry kept for land mortgages, and after such record, the amount so paid any contractor, by the city, shall constitute a lien upon the property fronting on the sidewalk so constructed; and in addition thereto a personal claim against the owner or owners, which lien may be foreclosed and enforced and such claim sued upon and collected in any court of competent jurisdiction, together with interest thereon at the rate of ten per cent per annum from the date of record. And this provision as to fixing lien for sidewalk improvements shall apply to sidewalks already built or improved as well as to those hereafter built or improved. The remedies herein provided for fixing liens shall not be deemed exclusive but held cumulative of existing remedies.</p>
<p>C. Raising Grades. Similar proceedings may be bad by the city to require and enforce the filling up and raising of premises to prescribed grades within the city, and in case the owner of any premises fails or refuses to obey the directions of any ordinance requiring his premises to be raised, the city may cause such work to be done by a contractor, as in the case of sidewalks and may establish and foreclose its lien for the cost of such work, and enforce its claim therefor per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sonally, against the owner of such premises, in the same manner as is herein pre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />scribed for the enforcement of the construction of sidewalks.</p>
<p>D. Grading and Paving Streets. Upon the completion of the work of grading, paving, repairing or otherwise improving any particular street or portion of a street, alley or avenue, under any ordinance of the city and the acceptance of such work by the city, it shall be the duty of the city council by ordinance to assess against each lot or parcel of land fronting on the street, alley or avenue, or portion thereof and against the owners of such lots, their proper share of the expenses of such improvements, and such assessments shall constitute a legal claim and demand against the owner or owners of such lots, a copy of such or<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dinance duly certified to, as correct, by the city secretary under the seal of the city, may be filed for record in the office of the county clerk of McLennan county accompanied with a description of the lots upon such<pb n="257" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="29" /><fw type="header" place="top">Special Laws of Texas.</fw>street or avenue or part thereof, and the amount assessed against each lot or par<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cel so improved which description may be inserted in the body of the ordinance with like effect as if attached; and such ordinance shall be recorded in the registry book of mortgages of lands and after such, record, the particular sums therein assessed against each lot or parcel of land, shall constitute a lien upon such lots or parcel, which lien may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. And this provision as to fixing liens for street improvements shall apply to streets al<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ready paved and improved as well as to those hereafter paved or improved; but as to the former shall be cumulative of existing remedies. But no assessment for a street paving or improvement shall ever exceed fifteen per cent of assessed value of abutting lots or parcels of land, nor shall any person be compelled to pay more than his proportionate part of the street that may be in front of his property. Provided, that all railway companies and street railway companies shall be liable for any grading, paving or other improvements hereafter made upon any portion -of streets or intersections of streets used or occupied by them, and the cost of such improvements shall operate as a lien upon the property of said companies until paid to the city. Which lien may be fixed in the same manner as is hereinbefore provided for fixing liens as against individuals.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. It being important that the additional powers herein granted to the City of Waco should take effect immediately in order that no delay may occur in the public works already in progress in said city, it is declared that an emer<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gency exists necessitating the suspension of the constitutional rule as to the time laws should take effect, and this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage, and the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read in each house on three several days be land the same is hereby suspended.</p>
<p>[Note.&#8212;The foregoing act originated in the Senate and passed the same by a vote of 22 yeas and no nays; and passed the House by a vote of 74 yeas and no navs.]</p>

<p>Sec. 154. Before the city of Denison shall be liable for damages of any kind, the person injured, or some one in his behalf, shall give the mayor or city council notice in writing of such injury within thirty days after the same has been re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceived, stating in such notice when, where and how the injury occurred, and the extent thereof, and the residence of the person so injured.</p>
<p>Sec. 155. It shall not be necessary in any action, suit or proceeding in which the city of Denison is a party, for any bond, undertaking or security to be exe<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cuted in behalf of said city, but all such actions, suits, appeals or proceedings shall be conducted in the same manner as if such bond, undertaking or security had been given, and said city shall be just as liable as if they had been duly given and executed.</p>
<p>Sec. 156. Whenever, in the opinion of the city council any building, fence, shed, awning or structure of any kind, or part thereof is liable to fall down or endanger persons or property, the council may order the owner or the agent of the same, or occupant of the premises, to take down and remove the same within such time as they may direct, and may punish by fine or imprisonment, or either, all persons failing to do so. Said council shall have the additional power to remove the same at the expense of the city on account of the owner of the property and assess the expenses thereof, including condemnation proceedings, as a special tax against the land, and the same may be collected as other special taxes provided for in this charter; or by suit in any competent court of jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Sec. 157. In all judicial proceedings it shall be sufficient to plead any ordinance by caption or by the number of sections thereof wanted and<pb n="284" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="56" /><fw type="header" place="top">Special Laws of Texas.</fw>the caption, and it shall not be necessary to plead the entire ordinance or section. All printed ordinances or codes of ordinances, published by authority of the coun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cil, shall be admitted in evidence, and shall have the same force and effect as would the original ordinances. The city courts and all courts exercising appellate juris<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />diction over its judgments shall take judicial notice of all valid ordinances of the City of Denison.</p>
<p>Sec. 158. The city council shall have full power and authority to grade, fill, raise, repair, macadamize, remacadamize, pave, repave, or otherwise improve any avenue, street or alley or any portion thereof in the city, to such extent, and out of such material, and under such regulations as said council may provide, when<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ever a majority of the aldermen present vote in favor of such improvement. All grading of streets and sidewalks shall be at the cost of the city. All repairing of streets shall be at the cost of the city unless herein otherwise provided. The word &#8220;repairing,&#8221; as here used, shall apply only to small or ordinary defects in streets that have been put to grade, and paved or macadamized. All other improvements, such as macadamizing, paving or repaving, shall be done in the following manner: The property owners on each side of the street so improved shall pay two-thirds of the cost, and the city shall pay the remaining one-third, the same to be recovered pro rata according to the number of front or abutting feet respectively owned by them on such street; provided, that when any person, corporation or company owns or operates any street railroad or rail<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />road of any kind on such street, avenue or alley, such person, corporation or com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pany shall pay for paving or otherwise improving that part of the street between the rails of such road, and a space one foot in width on each side of said rails. The city shall pay for all street intersections so improved, except that portion oc<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cupied or used by said railroads, which must be paid as above provided by the owners or operators thereof. Property owners shall pay the entire cost of all curbing. The pro rata share of the cost of such improvements due from property owners and said railroads as above provided, together with the expense of col<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lecting the same, shall be a special tax and lien against the lot or lots or blocks fronting or abutting upon the street improved, and against the road bed, ties, rails, fixtures, rights and franchises of such street or other railroads that may be operated thereon. The city council shall, by resolution, duly passed, designate the street or streets, avenues or alleys, or portions thereof, to be improved, the na<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ture of the improvements to be made and material to be used. Whenever the council shall so determine upon such improvement they shall advertise for bids, giving the plans, specifications and the extent of the improvement. The work shall be let to the lowest responsible bidder in the discretion of the council, and with such bonds as the council may require. Said council shall levy a special tax on the property fronting or abutting on the streets so improved for the pro rata, amounts due from property owners, and when street or other railroads are ope<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />rated on said street, the council shall levy, a special tax upon the road bed, ties, rails, fixtures, rights and franchises of such road for the pro rata share due from them for improving the space between the rails and the distance of one foot out<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />side of said rails of such roads. Said tax shall be levied; after said contract is let; shall become due and delinquent as the ordinance levying the same may specify; shall be a lien from the time of the levy and shall be used for the payment of said improvement. If said taxes be not paid as provided for by ordinance, their col<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lection shall be enforced as the collection of other taxes by advertisement, sale<pb n="285" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="57" /><fw type="header" place="top">Special Laws of Texas.</fw>of the property rights and franchises levied upon; provided, no sale shall be made by virtue of any special lien herein created, until the end of six months after such work is completed. At such sales, the collector shall execute to the purchaser a deed similar to the one executed when property is sold for ad valorem taxes. Nothing in this section shall be construed so as to prohibit the owner or owners in front of whose property such street improvement shall have been ordered, from doing such work, and thus avoid such special assessment against his or her prop<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />erty; provided, however, such owner or owners will obligate themselves to make and complete such street improvement within the time and in accordance with the plans and specifications made by order of the city council.</p>
<p>Sec. 159. In all cases of special assessment for local improvements of any land, against any property, persons or corporations whatsoever, and said assessments have failed to be valid, in whole or in part, because for want of form, insufficiency or non-compliance with the charter provision governing such assessment, the city council shall be and are hereby authorized to re-assess said special taxes or assess<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments and to enforce their collection in accordance with the charter provisions existing at the time the re-assessment is made.</p>
<p>Sec. 160. The city council shall fix and determine the nature and extent of sidewalk improvements and decide as to the kind of material to be used. The cost of constructing all sidewalks, including curbing and the keeping the same in repairs together with the cost of collection, (but not including the grading) shall be defrayed entirely by the property owners of the lots or blocks fronting on the sidewalks to be constructed, according to the number of feet frontage owned by each. Whenever the council, by resolution or otherwise orders the construction of any sidewalk and notice thereof has been served on the property owner, if in the city, or if out of the city, upon his agent, it shall be the duty of such property owner, or his agent, to at once construct such sidewalk as ordered by the council and under the supervision of the city engineer. If such property owner or his agent shall fail to construct such sidewalk within the time required by the coun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cil, then the city may have it constructed and the expense of the same, together with the cost of collection, shall be a charge against the owner and a special tax and lien upon the property until paid, and its collection may be enforced by sale of the property in the same manner as provided for the collection of the special tax and lien for street improvements in this act; or the same may be collected by a suit against the property owner and the lien upon the property foreclosed in any court having jurisdiction; provided, no action shall be had to enforce such special tax and lien until after the expiration of six months from the time such tax was levied. In addition hereto the city council shall have power by ordinance to pun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ish persons who fail or refuse to build or repair sidewalks after having been duly notified.</p>
<p>Sec. 161. All writs, subpoenas or other process, issuing out of the city court shall run in the name of the City of Denison and may be executed and served by the chief of police or his deputies or policemen anywhere within Grayson county.</p>
<p>Sec. 162. All property, real and personal, belonging to the City of Denison, is hereby vested in the corporation created by this act, and the officers of said cor<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />poration now in office shall continue the same, as officers of the corporation hereby created, until superceded in conformity to the provisions hereof, but shall be governed by this act from and after it takes effect.</p>

<p>Sec. 163. This act shall not invalidate any legal action heretofore done by the city council of the City of Denison, or any of its officers, or impair any liabilities which may have been created by said corporation prior to the passage of this act, but such liability shall be and remain valid as against the corporation hereby created.</p>

If such companies shall fail to do such things after being notified, the city can have same done at the ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pense of such companies.</p>
<p>Sec. 169. The style of all ordinances shall be: &#8220;Be it Ordained by the City Coun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cil of the City of Denison;&#8221; but the same may be omitted from ordinances pub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lished in book or pamphlet form.</p>

Certified copies of ordi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nances shall also be received in evidence.</p>
<p>Sec. 173. All ordinances, resolutions, rules and regulations now in force in the City of Denison, and not in conflict herewith shall be and remain in force under this act, throughout the limits provided in Sec. 2 of this act, until altered, amended or repealed by the city council after this act takes effect.</p>
<p>Sec. 174. That every ordinance passed by the city council shall be enrolled by the secretary within the next succeeding five days, Sundays excepted, or as soon thereafter as practicable.

If errors exist they shall be cor<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />rected. If no errors exist or if found, then after their correction, the member making the comparison shall endorse on the margin the words: &#8220;Correctly en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />rolled,&#8221; and give the date thereon and subscribe his name thereto. Whereupon the same shall be delivered immediately to the mayor for his consideration.<pb n="287" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="59" /><fw type="header" place="top">Special Laws of Texas.</fw>If the mayor approve the same it shall become a law. If he fail to approve or ob<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ject to same within ten days, exclusive of the day of presentation and Sunday, should that intervene, the same shall become a law without his signature. But if in said time he shall veto the same, he shall present his written objection to the council by filing the same with the city secretary, and unless the council pass the ordinance over the mayor&#8217;s veto by the majority hereinbefore provided, the same shall not become a law.</p>
<p>Sec. 175. The city council shall have the right to remit in whole or in part any fine or penalty belonging to the city, which may be imposed under any ordinance or resolution passed in pursuance of this act by a two-thirds vote of all the council present.</p>

<p>Section 3. The municipal government of said city shall consist of a city coun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cil, composed of a mayor, four aldermen at large and one alderman from each ward. A majority of the aldermen elected shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, except at a call meeting or meetings for the imposition of taxes, when three-fourths of the aldermen elected shall be required unless herein otherwise specified. The officers of the corporation shall be a recorder, a treasurer, ran assessor, a collector, a clerk, a chief of police, deputy chief of police, an engineer, (who shall also be superintendent of streets), an attorney, an auditor, a health physician, a harbor master, a city sexton and such other officers and agents as the council may direct; all of whom, except the clerk, chief of police and recorder, shall be nominated by the mayor on the second Monday after each biennial elec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion, or as soon thereafter as possible, and each of whom shall be confirmed by a majority of the city council.

In the event that any nominee of the mayor is not con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />firmed by the city council, the mayor shall at an adjourned meeting nominate some other person for the office not filled at the regular day, and continue to make a nomination or renomination until some person shall be confirmed<pb n="289" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="61" /><fw type="header" place="top">Special Laws of Texas.</fw>by the city council. No person shall be nominated the third time for the same office except by consent of the city council, and the city council can only adjourn from day to day until all the city officers shall have been nominated and con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />firmed. Should the mayor fail or refuse to make the nomination or nominations or after having named four persons for any office, all of whom have been rejected by the city council, then in such event the city council shall have the right to elect by a vote of nine some person to the office yet unfilled. All said officers so nominated by the mayor and confirmed by the city council, or elected by the city council, and the city clerk, chief of police and recorder, appointed by the mayor, shall hold their offices until the second Monday after the next biennial election and until the appointment and qualification of their successors, unless removed by the mayor or by the city council under authority vested in it by this charter.

And at the same time there shall be elected one al<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />derman from each ward of the city by the qualified voters of such ward, who shall hold his office for two years from the date of said election, and until his successor shall be elected and qualified. Provided, no one shall vote for the election of alder<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />man at any such election unless he shall have been a resident of such ward thirty days next preceding such election. Provided further that the person so elected shall be and remain a resident of the ward which he is elected to represent, and if he shall remove from the ward during the term of his office the same shall be de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />clared vacated. The persons receiving the highest number of votes in the whole city for mayor and aldermen at large shall be declared elected; and the person receiving the highest number of votes cast for alderman in their respective wards, shall be declared elected. In case the person elected mayor shall refuse to accept the office, the city council, mayor, or acting mayor, shall order another election; and in case of a vacancy in the office of mayor, by death, resignation, removal or otherwise, it shall be filled for the remainder of the term by a new election, to be ordered by the city council, or acting mayor. And in case of vacancy in the office of alderman, by refusal to accept or qualify, or by death, resignation, removal or otherwise, the city council, mayor, or acting mayor, shall order a new election to fill the residue of the unexpired term; and all special elections shall be conducted in the same manner as is herein provided for the biennial election; provided, that in special elections, five days notice thereof shall be sufficient.</p>

He shall have like power with a justice of the peace to adminis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ter oaths of office and also all oaths and affirmations, and to give certificates thereof.

Every policeman shall be required to take the oath prescribed by the constitution of the state, and to give bond, with sureties, to be approved by the mayor, in the sum of five hundred dollars, payable to the city of Galveston, and conditioned for the faithful discharge of his duties. All lawful rules and regulations prescribed by the city council for the government of the police department shall be obeyed by the police force and its officers on pain of dismissal, or such lighter punishment, either by suspension, reduction or forfeiture of pay or otherwise, as the commission may adjudge; provided, however, that all changes or complaints against the chief of police shall be heard and determined by the city council as provided in section 150, 151, 152 and 158 of this charter for the trial of the mayor or any alderman. The commission shall have power to administer oaths, to summon and compel the at<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tendance of witnesses before them, and to examine such witnesses upon any mat<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ter where it may be necessary to the discharge of their duties; and they shall report to the city council at its first regular meeting in each month, the expenses incurred by their department, and the suspensions and removals therein during the preceding month.

Two of the appointed commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioners shall be appointed to serve for the term of two years and two for the term of four years, but after the expiration of the first term of two years the other appointment shall be for the term of four years, in order that biennially two commissioners may be appointed; and they shall hold their office until their successors are duly elected and qualified. Said commissioners, except the city en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gineer, who is provided for in the regular salary list of city officers, shall be en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />titled to receive such salary as the city council may determine, not to exceed three hundred dollars each per annum payable quarterly.

Upon the appoint<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment and qualification of said commissioners, they shall organize by the election of a president from their own number. The city clerk shall be the secretary for said board and shall keep a record of its proceedings, and a majority of the com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioners shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. No com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioner shall absent himself from any meeting except for good cause, and an ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cuse for non-attendance shall be entered in the minute book of said board of com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioners, and if at any time more than two commissioners be absent from the city, the mayor, if he believe it to be necessary, shall have the authority, with the consent of the city council, temporarily to appoint a new mem<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ber on said board until the return of one of the absent commissioners,<pb n="302" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="74" /><fw type="header" place="top">Special Laws of Texas.</fw>who must qualify, however, in the same manner as the regularly elected commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioners.

The city council shall, however, before any such public work is undertaken by the commissioners, designate the same, and the extent thereof by a proper resolution, and for a better understanding of the work to be undertaken, shall require of said board of commissioners an approximate estimate thereof. After the city council has duly adopted by resolution, what work or improvement shall be un<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dertaken, and has stipulated its extent, it shall be the duty of the commissioners to advertise for the work according to plans and specifications, to be made and adopted by them, and shall let the work by contract, except where the city coun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cil may, upon recommendation from said board, authorize the work to be done by days work; and all contracts shall be subject to approval by the city council, and shall be signed by the mayor and countersigned by the city clerk, before the same shall take effect; any contract made under this act shall be paid for by the city with the proceeds of the five per cent forty-year bonds issued for the par<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ticular purpose, and by funds set apart for that purpose by the city council in its annual budget; provided, that in all contracts for public works or improvements, of whatever kind, in which the city is interested, labor in and about the construc<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion of such work, contracts or improvements shall be rated and paid for at not less than two dollars per day of nine hours each. The board shall keep a record of their proceedings in a well bound book kept for that purpose, and they shall report monthly, to the city council, the progress of all works under their charge, and make recommendations as to what further work should or could be under<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />taken, its nature and extent, and shall approve all claims for work or works under their charge, entitled to payment, which said claims shall be duly audited and approved by the finance committee before payment. No member of the board of commissioners of public works shall have any other employment or office under the city government while he is a member of said board, unless herein otherwise pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided; and no member of said board shall be directly or indirectly interested in any work, business or contract, the expense, price or consideration of which is paid from the city treasury, or by an assessment levied by an ordinance or reso<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lution of the city council, nor be the surety of any having a contract, work or business with said city, for the performance of which security may be required. Any member of said board violating the provisions hereof shall forfeit his posi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion on said board, and shall thereafter be ineligible to any office in or under the city government.

<p>Section 14. That there shall be elected by the qualified voters of said city, a city attorney, treasurer, city marshal, assessor and collector of taxes, a market master, a city recorder, a street commissioner, and health officer, city scavenger and city engineer, who shall hold their respective offices for two years, and until their suc<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cessors are qualified, unless sooner removed by the city council; provided, that the present officers of said city shall hold their offices until the next election of city officers as prescribed by the ordinances now in force.

Such recorder&#8217;s court shall be open daily, and the accused shall have a speedy public trial.

<p>That section 23a shall hereafter read as follows:</p>
<p>Section 23a. The city council shall fix and determine the nature and extent of all sidewalks, curbing, street, drainage and sewerage improvements and de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cide as to the kind of material to be used. The cost of constructing or repair<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing, as the case may be, of all sidewalks, foot ways and curbing, and the cost of grading, shelling, paving, repairing, or otherwise improving any avenue, street, alley, or other highway or any portion thereof within the limits of the city, and the cost of all drains and sewers laid and constructed within the city, together with the cost of collecting thereof shall, whenever by a vote of two<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />thirds of the aldermen elected, such improvements shall be declared necessary for the public interest, be defrayed in case of curbing, sidewalk and street im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />provement, by the owner or owners of the lot or lots, block or blocks, tracts of land when not laid out into lots and blocks, abutting or [on] such street or por<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion of street improved, according to the cost of work in front of the particular lot or block or tract of land, but the cost against the several lots in any block may be reached according to foot frontage by estimate based on the entire cost of work in front of such block, from center to center of cross streets, and where the cross streets lead into the improved street at irregular distances, such ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />portionment by estimate may be between the lines of projections run into the center of such cross streets, and in such case the intersection to be paid for by the city, shall extend only to the center of the improved street, and in case of<pb n="308" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="80" /><fw type="header" place="top">Special Laws of Texas.</fw>sewerage or drainage improvements, shall be defrayed by the owner or owners of such lot or lots, block or blocks or tracts of land when not laid out into lots or blocks, according to the proportionate benefits of the lots, blocks or tracts of land within the sewerage or drainage district hereinafter provided for, taking into con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sideration the area and locality of the property affected, and the costs of all such improvements shall be a tax and charge against the person or persons owning such lots, blocks or tracts of land at the time such tax or any portion thereof shall be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />come due as to such lots, blocks and tracts of land and a lien and incumbrance upon the land itself, and said tax against the property owner may be collected and the lien upon the property foreclosed in any court having jurisdiction. The city council shall have power to provide by ordinance for the laying out of drainage and sewerage districts within said city and to provide for the cost of constructing main and lateral drains, sewers or conduits in such districts by assessessment against the owner or owners of the lots, blocks or tracts of land, when not laid out in lots and blocks, in such sewerage or drainage district according to the proportional benefit respectively to such lots, blocks or tracts of land, in view of area and locality, and main sewers and drains may be constructed, and the cost of the same assessed against the land within such district, as aforesaid in contemplation of additional lateral or cross sewers, or drains being constructed within such district at some fu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ture time. The cost of constructing curb walls and gutters and sidewalks on the corner of any block shall be assessed against the owner or owners of the corner lot or tract of land abutting thereon. Provided nothing in this act shall be construed to prevent the city council from constructing sewers and drains or making street improvements in whole or in part at the expense of the city, should it be deemed advisable so to do. The city council shall, by resolution duly passed, designate the streets or portion of streets on which curbing, sidewalk, or street improvements shall be made or constructed, and the district within which sewerage or drainage improvements shall be constructed, and the general nature of the improvements to be made, and the principal ingredient of the material to be used; provided how<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ever, that provision may be made in such resolution for receiving bids on more than one kind of material, or of different modes of construction. Said resolution may be amended or changed by a two-thirds vote of the city council, at any time previous to the publication of the advertisement for bids, and it shall be proper to embody in the same, language to the effect that the improvements contemplated will be made only on those portions of the street or streets referred to where good and suf<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ficient improvements of like character do not exist, and in such event the mayor as the work progresses shall determine where such existing improvements, if any, are in fact good and sufficient within the meaning and intent of the resolution, and he shall direct the contractor accordingly, and any property owner shall have the privilege of putting down his own sidewalks and curbing in front of any lot owned by him, provided the same are completed or in course of construction, prior to the leaving of material near the same for that purpose by the contractor employed by the city, and if in course of construction, are completed in a manner sat<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />isfactory to the mayor, at such time to be determined by the mayor, as will not interfere with the work being otherwise done by the contractor. When sewerage or drainage improvements are contemplated, said resolu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion shall refer to the district within which property will be assessed for the payment of the same. The cost of paving any street intersection under<pb n="309" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="81" /><fw type="header" place="top">Special Laws of Texas.</fw>the provisions of this act, shall be borne by the city, and the city council is hereby authorized to levy an annual ad valorem tax, not exceeding one-fourth of one per cent per annum, for the purpose of paying for the paving of intersections, and provisions shall at the time be made by the city to assess and collect annually a sufficient sum to pay the interest thereon, and create a sinking fund of at least two per cent. The city shall have the same time in which to pay for such work as individuals have under the provisions of this act, and street intersections as here used, shall be deemed to mean all that portion of the street improved within an extension of the curb lines of the intersecting streets. Any railroad or street railway company shall be liable for the cost of grading, paving or otherwise im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />proving the portion of the street or intersection used or occupied by such railway company, and such costs shall be a lien upon the property and franchises of the company. The portion of a street occupied by any railroad or street railway company shall be deemed to mean all that portion of the same between the rails of all tracks laid and extending six inches beyond the outer edge of the rails of such road, and including the space between the double tracks and between the main track, side tracks or turnouts. Any railroad or street railway company, or other person having an casement in any land not in, but abutting on the street, shall be liable for street curbing, sidewalk, drainage or sewerage improvements in the same manner as though it or he were the owner of such land, and a lien shall exist on such land, inclusive of such casement right, to secure the cost of such im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />provement. Should any railroad or street railway company propose to lay a track on any street or portion of a street which shall have been improved under the provisions of section 23 et seq., of this act, it shall become liable according to the portion of the street occupied by such company, as defined above, for such portion of the cost of improvement as the city council may direct, not in excess of what would have been its proportion of the original cost of the improvements had its track been on the ground when the improvement was made; and such amounts when collected shall be credited on the assessments made against abut<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ting property and the city council may by ordinance provide for the form and man<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ner of collecting and disbursing the same. Before any railroad or street rail<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />way company shall be permitted to occupy such improved street or portion of street, it shall file with the city secretary in writing, prepared by the city attor<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ney, an acceptance of the terms on which its occupancy of the same shall be per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mitted.</p>
<p>That section 23b shall hereafter read as follows:</p>
<p>Section 23b. After the passage of a resolution of the character next hereinbefore referred to, it shall be the dirty of the city secretary to have said resolution or so much of the substance of the same advertised for not less than four days in some daily newspaper published in the city of Houston, as will inform any person own<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing property liable to be affected by said resolution of the fact that the making of improvements is contemplated by the city council, which if carried out will sub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ject his property to a special tax assessment for the payment of the same, and no further action in regard to the proposed improvements referred to in such publication shall be taken until the lapse of ten days from the first publication thereof; provided, however, that failure to advertise the same for more than one day, or any mistake or omission in the wording of said advertise<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment shall in no way vitiate or affect the validity of special assessments levied under the same. After the passage of such resolutions, specifica<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="310" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="82" /><fw type="header" place="top">Special Laws of Texas.</fw>tions for the improvements referred to in the same shall be prepared by the city engineer, from time to time as the work progresses, which specifications, when prepared and adopted by the city council, shall be open for public inspection in the office of the city secretary, or that of the city engineer, and it shall be proper to provide in said specifications for such reasonable alterations in the grade, plan, form or dimensions of the work or additions to the same, as may be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />come apparent or found to be necessary or expedient by the city engineer, or the board of public works, as the work referred to in the same progresses; provided, however, that it shall be the duty of said board of public works to examine said specifications, and a majority of the members thereof shall endorse their report in reference to the same thereon, or affix it thereto before the same are approved by the city council; provided further, however, that said city council shall never<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />theless have the right, after such report shall have been made by the board of public works, to amend or change said specifications without further reference to said board. After said specifications shall have been finally approved by the city council, bids for the construction of said improvements shall be solicited by public advertisement duly made, which advertisement shall refer to said specifications, and the work provided for in the same shall be let to the lowest bidder, to be judged of by the city council. Said advertisements shall be published in the city inviting bids thereon, and the same shall state the time when such proposals will be opened, and shall show the manner in which the work is to be paid for. All proposals shall be addressed to the city secretary, and shall be opened in the pres<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ence of the city council at a regular meeting. Bond to be fixed in amount by the city council, and approved by the mayor shall be required of all contractors.</p>
<p>That section 23c shall hereafter read as follows:</p>
<p>Section 23c. After a bid for the construction of sidewalk, curbing, street, drain<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />age or sewerage improvements shall have been accepted by the council, and a con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tract for the construction of the same entered into from time to time, as rapidly as practicable, there shall be prepared by the city engineer a roll, or rolls, showing the number of lots, blocks or tracts of land when not divided into lots and blocks, fronting on the street, alley, avenue or highway to be improved, or in case of sewerage or drainage or other improvements within the district provided for, the name or names of the owner or owners of such lot or part of lot, block or tract of land if known to the city engineer, and if unknown to him it shall be so stated, the number of feet frontage of such lot, part of lot, block or tract of land front<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing on the portion of the street improved, in the case of sidewalk, curbing or street improvements, and the proportional cost to such lot, part of lot, block or tract of land, in view of area and locality, in the case of sewerage or drainage im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />provements and the total cost as ascertained and calculated by the city engineer of such improvements necessary to be borne by each, and to be paid by each owner of such property described in such roll. After said city engineer shall have pre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pared a roll as provided for, covering any portion of the work embraced in the contract, he shall endorse thereon a certificate, in substance as fol<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lows: &#8220;I certify that the above and foregoing roll of ownership and esti<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mate sheet is correct and that I have honestly and faithfully prepared the same;&#8221; and he shall sign his name to such certificate. It shall then be the duty of the board of public works to examine such roll of ownership and the majority of the members of said board shall endorse thereon, or attach thereto, such report in reference to the same as they may deem proper. It<pb n="311" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="83" /><fw type="header" place="top">Special Laws of Texas.</fw>shall also be the duty of the city attorney to examine said roll, nor shall the same be submitted to the city council for approval until he shall have certified that such roll of ownership is in due form as required by the city charter. After the publication of said resolution hereinbefore referred to it shall be the duty of all persons owning land liable to assessment for the cost of improvements referred to in such resolution, to file in the office of the city engineer, previous to the comple<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion of said roll of ownership, a correct description of all such land owned by them, and any one failing so to do shall not be permitted, after the final approval of said roll of ownership, to resist the payment of the full sum therein assessed against him, or against property owned by him, on account of any mistake or omission in said roll pertaining to the description of the land so owned by him, or to the name or names appearing in said roll as the owners of the same. It shall, however, be the duty of the city engineer to exercise reasonable diligence in ascertaining the name of the owner of the respective tracts of land referred to in such roll of ownership, and in describing such tracts of land correctly, and for this purpose it shall be sufficient for him to adopt the description and desig<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nation of ownership appearing in the latest assessment rolls of the City of Houston, prepared for purposes of general taxation, completed at the time of the preparation of such rolls of ownership. The said roll, when approved by the city council shall be prima facie evidence, that all prerequisites required by law per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />taining to the levying of said assessment have been complied with, and in case of suit by said city to enforce said assessments, all the provisions of this act re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lating to misnomer, misdescription and to suits against unknown owners in case of certificates, shall apply in favor of said city.</p>
<p>That section 23d shall hereafter read as follows:</p>
<p>Section 23d. After a roll of ownership shall have been prepared, as above pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided for, the same shall be placed in the office of the city secretary for public inspection, and it shall thereupon be the duty of the city secretary to cause to be published, for not less than four days in some daily newspaper published in the City of Houston, a notice, in form substantially as follows:</p>
<p>&#8220;Persons owning property on (here insert the name of the street or streets, or description of portions of the same referred to in said roll, or a description of the territory or district to which such roll relates), are hereby notified that the roll of ownership showing the amount of the special assessment tax levied against the owners of property above referred to, to cover the cost of improvement made in accordance with the resolution of the city council relating to the same, adopted (here insert the date of the resolution) has been placed in the office of the city secretary for inspection, in order that all persons interested therein, or to be af<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fected thereby, may have an opportunity of calling the attention of the city council to any errors or mistakes connected with such assessments levied against property owned by them as shown on said roll;&#8221; and said roll shall in no event be adopted or approved by the city council until after the lapse of ten days after the first publication of said notice. And on the filing of said roll in the office of the city secretary for public inspection as aforesaid, it shall be the duty of the city secretary to mail a copy of said notice to the postoffice address, so far as known to him, of all persons whose names appear on said roll. And where the postoffice address of any person named in said roll is unknown to said city secre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tary, he shall address a letter, containing said notice, to Houston, Texas; pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided, however, that failure on the part of said city secretary to comply with<pb n="312" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="84" /><fw type="header" place="top">Special Laws of Texas.</fw>the provisions above stated, in respect to mailing said notice to any person named in said rolls, shall in no wise impair or affect the validity of said roll, or the va<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lidity of the assessment provided for by the same; the publication of said resolu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion or substance of the same, as hereinbefore provided for, and the publication of said notice, shall be notice to all persons owning property against which special tax assessment for sidewalk, street, drainage or sewerage improvements, or for any other purpose, may be made, of the pendency of the proceedings had and to be had, and acts taken and to be taken in reference to the same; and such person shall be permitted, at any time after the date of the first of such publication, and previous to the final approval of said rolls by the city council, by petition to the city council filed with the city secretary, to object to any such acts and proceedings, and to show wherein they have been or may be wronged or injured thereby, and to ask for a revision or correction of the same; and they shall be permitted, and it shall be their duty before the final approval of such roll, to ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pear in person, or by agent or attorney before said city council, and not there<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />after, at any time, before any other tribunal, fraud and collusion, which was then unknown and could not by reasonable diligence have been ascertained, ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cepted, and apply for redress for such wrong or injury, and for the correction of such errors as they may point out and establish to the satisfaction of said coun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cil; nor shall any such roll be finally approved by the city council after the filing of such petition by any person so affected or liable to be affected by said pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceedings, until such petition shall have been heard and acted upon by the city council, although it shall not be necessary to incorporate in the minutes of said city council its action thereon, and it shall be the duty of any person who may deem himself injured by the action or non-action of the city council in reference to the matters contained in such petition, within five days after the approval of such roll of ownership, to apply to the proper court for an injunction, based on the facts alleged in such petition, restraining further action on the part of the city officials, or any of them, in reference to the matters complained of in such petition, and to the extent of the petitioner&#8217;s interest in the same, and neglect or failure so to do shall forever estop such petitioner, and all parties claiming under him from denying the correctness of said roll, or the regularity of all proceedings previously had in reference thereto or the validity of the special tax therein as<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sessed against the land owned by him; and at all times and in all proceedings in any court in which the validity of any special tax assessment that may have been laid under the charter of the city of Houston or amendments thereto, as shown by any roll of ownership, purporting to have been prepared by the city en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gineer in accordance with the provisions thereof, may be called in question; a recovery shall nevertheless be had in such suit for such sum as ought to have been assessed against the tract of land involved, according to the mode of apportion<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment, provided in the law of said city applicable to such improvement, and if for any reason, in law or fact, such recovery cannot be had, then a recovery shall be allowed, quantum valebat, not exceeding the contract price for the improvement in front of the lot or lots, block of blocks, or tracts of land involved, according to the front foot rule or standard; and if for any reason, in law or fact, recovery can not be had in either of the above modes, then recovery shall be allowed not exceed<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing the contract price, to the extent and according to the standard of benefits from the improvements in question to the lot or lots, block or blocks, or tracts of land involved, and such recovery in whichsoever mode allowed, shall be<pb n="313" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="85" /><fw type="header" place="top">Special Laws of Texas.</fw>a lien on such lot or lots, block or blocks, or tract of land for such amount as shall be established, together with eight per cent thereon from the date of the accept<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ance of said work by the city, and such lien shall be established and foreclosed accordingly. In case of curbing, sidewalk and street improvements, whether the recovery is had on the original assessment or otherwise, the lien shall extend in depth as to tracts of land not laid out into lots and blocks to the usual depth of lots in said city, namely one hundred feet.</p>
<p>That section 23e shall hereafter read as follows:</p>
<p>Section 23e. The sum assessed against each separate tract of land whether em<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />bracing one or more lots or not, as described in said roll of ownership next above referred to shall, unless otherwise provided in the resolution under which it is prepared, be divided by the city secretary into annual installments of as nearly equal amounts as may be deemed by him most practicable and convenient; pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided, however, that the sum assessed against each separate tract of land shall be divided by him into as many annual installments as possible, not exceeding ten in number, and not less than ten dollars each. The first of said installments shall become due five days after said roll of ownership shall have been approved by the city council, and each of the remaining installments shall become due annually on the same day of the month in each year thereafter until all are due. On each of the respective days last referred to the entire interest on the whole amount of prin<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cipal then unpaid shall also become due. The entire amount assessed against each separate tract of land shall bear interest at the rate of eight per cent per annum until maturity, and each installment shall bear interest at the rate of ten per cent per annum after maturity of the same. Failure to pay any installment of prin<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cipal and interest when due, within sixty days of the time when suit shall have been entered on the same, shall, at the option of the party entitled to collect such indebtedness, cause all subsequent installments of principal and interest to mature and become due, and shall authorize the foreclosure of the lien for all installments of principal and interest unpaid. It shall be the duty of the city secretary, on the filing of said roll of ownership, and after the lapse of five days after its final approval by the city council, to divide the sums assessed against each separate tract of land described in said roll into installments as above provided for, and he shall add to each installment the amount of interest annually to become due on the entire amount of the principal unpaid at the maturity of such installment, which sum shall be the amount of the principal and interest due for each year respectively, on such tract of land, and he shall preserve in his office a list or roll, showing the result of such calculation as an adjunct to said roll of ownership.

<p>Whereas, on the fourth day of March, 1881, J. A. Belvin filed and settled on the N. W. 1/4 of section 44, cert. 5/77 H. &#38; T. B. Ry Co. situated in Brown county, Texas, which was sold by the State to him for $160.00, and in compliance with law, he made the first payment of $16.00 to the county surveyor who was to have for<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />warded the same to the General Land Office with the application.</p>
<p>And whereas through the negligence of the county surveyor, said file and ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />plication was never perfected on account of a mistake in the field notes, and the same was never entered in the Land Office.</p>
<p>And whereas, in 1882, the new county surveyor of said county refused to correct the field notes so made by the first surveyor, but caused and required a new file to be made on the land by the said J.

<p>Section 201. In the widening or straightening of any street, avenue, alley, plaza, square, park or other highway, the city council shall determine, by ordinance, the manner and extent of such widening or straightening. Upon the filing of such ordinance and the plan of the proposed widening with the county clerk, it shall be the duty of the county judge to appoint three disinterested freeholders of the city as commissioners, who, after being sworn to act with fidelity and impartiality, shall carefully estimate the value of the property necessary to be taken for such widening or straightening, making a separate estimate in the case of each owner. It shall be thereafter the duty of the commissioners to estimate the benefits ac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cruing to any property on the street or in the vicinity that they may consider benefitted by such improvements, filing with their report a list of the owners of such property and the amount of the supposed benefit stated separately in each case. On the filing of such report with the city clerk the city council shall, at their first meeting, or as soon as practicable thereafter, give five days public notice through the official journal, at which time said report will be acted upon (which shall not be less than ten days after the expiration of said notice), and all parties feeling aggrieved by the action of said commissioners may be heard by the council on appeal.

<p>Section 203. Whenever the city council shall deem it necessary to take private property for the use of the city, for streets, avenues, alleys,<pb n="356" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="128" /><fw type="header" place="top">Special Laws of Texas.</fw>plazas, squares, parks, hospitals, pest houses, school houses or any other public buildings or uses, such property may be taken for such purpose by making just compensation to the owner thereof. If the amount of such compensation cannot be agreed upon, it shall be duty of the city council to cause to be stated in writing the particular property required, the name of the owner and his residence, if known, and file the same with the city clerk. Thereafter the city clerk shall notify the owner or agent, if known, of the filing of such statement. The damage to accrue to the owner, by reason of such condemnation, shall be assessed by three disinterested freeholders of the city, one to be selected by the owner of the prop<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />erty, one to be selected by the mayor, the third to be selected by the two thus ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pointed, who, after being sworn to perform the duties of their appointment with fidelity and impartiality, shall assess the damages to accrue by reason of such con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />demnation. In the event the owner of the property shall fail to appoint the com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioner hereinbefore provided for, within ten days from the service of the notice of the city clerk, the mayor shall appoint such commissioner. In the event that the two commissioners cannot agree upon the selection of the third, then the county judge, on application, shall appoint the said commissioner. The city council shall provide, by ordinance, for the service of the notice herein provided for, and shall also provide the method of assessing the damage to accrue to the owner of the property.</p>
<p>Section 227. The mayor shall cause a quarterly exhibit of the financial affairs of the city to be published in the official journal. The mayor shall also, within thirty days after the close of every fiscal year, cause to be published in pamphlet form, for general distribution, an exhibit of the financial condition of the city for such fiscal year, which exhibit shall specify the number and date of each warrant drawn, the amount, thereof, the name of the person to whom the same was issued, and for what purpose or account the same was drawn. Every taxpaying citizen shall, during office hours, have the right to examine any and all books, vouchers, records and papers belonging to the city and in the custody of its officers, and shall have the right to take copies; and it shall be the duty of the proper custodian of a paper or record appertaining to the city or its business to produce and exhibit any such paper or record demanded to be inspected by any such citizen.</p>
<p>Section 249. The officers of the city of San Antonio herein named shall receive from the city the following compensation and no more:</p>
<p>First. The mayor shall receive the sum of $3600 per annum.</p>
<p>Second. The city auditor shall receive $1800 per annum.</p>
<p>Third. The recorder shall receive the sum of $1200 per annum.</p>
<p>Fourth. The city marshal [shall] receive the sum of $2000 per annum.</p>

<p>Sixth. The collector shall receive the sum of $2700 per annum, and shall pay his own clerks or assistants.</p>
<p>Seventh. The assessor shall receive the sum of $2000 per annum.</p>
<p>Eighth. The treasurer shall receive the sum of $1200 per annum.</p>
<p>Ninth. The engineer shall receive the sum of $2000 per annum.</p>
<p>Section 251. The salaries of the officers named in the preceding section shall be payable monthly out of the city treasury, at the end of each month, on warrants drawn by the mayor and attested by the clerk in accordance with said section from and after the passage of this act.</p>
<p>Sec. 2.

<opener>
<salute>An act to create a more efficient road system in the county of Lavaca and to provide for the appointment of road overseers therein and to define the powers and jurisdiction of the commissioners court of said county with regard thereto.</salute>
</opener>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That the commissioners court of Lavaca county may appoint a convenient number of road overseers in said county who shall hold their offices for two years and until their successors are appointed and qualified.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. The road overseers so appointed shall perform all the duties required of overseers under the general laws of this State and such other duties as may be required of them by the Commissioners court of said county and shall receive such compensation as the Commissioners court may prescribe not to exceed one dollar and fifty cents per day for the time actually engaged.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. Each overseer shall, within twenty days after his appointment, take the oath prescribed in the constitution, and enter into bond payable to the County Judge in such sum as may be fixed by the Commissioners court, to be approved by the County Judge, conditioned that he will faithfully discharge all of the duties incumbent upon him as such road overseer and pay out and account for all the money that may come into his hands according to law and the requirements of the commissioners court, which bond shall not be void on the first recovery, but may be sued on from time to time until the full amount is exhausted.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. The Commissioners court may for good cause remove any overseer and in case of vacancy from any cause may fill the same by appointment.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. Each road overseer shall take charge of all tools, implements and teams placed under his control by the Commissioners court, and exe<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="358" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="130" /><fw type="header" place="top">Special Laws of Texas.</fw>cute his receipt therefor, which shall be filed, with the County Clerk, and he shall be responsible for all such tools, teams, implements and machinery and the proper expenditures and paying out of all money belonging to the road fund that may come into his hands, and shall be liable for the loss, injury or destruction of any such tools, teams, implements, or machinery, if the result of his negligence, or for the wrongful or improper expenditure of such money, and upon the expiration of his term of office, or in case of his resignation or removal he shall deliver all such money and property to his successor or such other person as the commissioners court may direct.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. The Commissioners court shall require all county convicts not otherwise employed to labor upon the public roads under such regulations as may be most expedient. Each county convict worked on the roads in satisfaction of any fine and cost, shall receive a credit thereon of fifty cents for each day he may labor, and the county shall pay to the officers one-half of any cost that may have been adjudged against such convict coming to such officers. The Commissioners court may grant a reasonable commutation of time for faithful services and good behavior.</p>
<p>Sec. 7. The overseers may contract with any person subject to road duty for the use of teams, and permit such person to discharge his road duty by the use of such double team; he shall never allow more than $2.00 per day for any team, nor more than $3.00 for any hand and double team.</p>
<p>Sec. 8. It shall be the duty of each road overseer to see that all of the roads and bridges in his road precinct are kept in good repair and see that every person subject to road duty in his road precinct performs the work for which he is liable under the law. He shall act as supervisor of the roads in his road precinct and perform all the duties as supervisor that now devolves upon the commissioner; and the county commissioners of said county are relieved from the performance of the duties prescribed by article 4390a. Revised Civil Statutes.</p>
<p>Sec. 9. Each road overseer shall make a report under oath to the Commission<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ers court every six months showing an itemized statement of all money belonging to the road fund he has received, from whom received, and what disposition he has made of the same, the condition of all roads and bridges in his road precinct and such other matters as the court may require information upon and shall make such other reports at such times as such court may require.</p>
<p>Sec. 10. Any road overseer who shall wilfully fail or refuse to comply with any provisions of this act or order of the Commissioners court or to perform any duty required of him by law shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction thereof punished by fine of not less than ten nor more than two hundred dollars.</p>
<p>Sec. 11. This act shall be cumulative of all general laws on the subject of roads and bridges not in conflict herewith, and where not otherwise provided herein, such general laws shall apply, but in case of conflict with general laws the pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />visions of the act shall govern.</p>
<p>Section 12. The fact that there is now no sufficient road law in Lavaca county, and that the roads therein are in bad condition, creates an emergency and an im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />perative public necessity that the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days be suspended, and that this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage, and said rule is suspended, and it is so enacted.</p>
