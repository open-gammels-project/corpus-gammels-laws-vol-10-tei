<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: Every person, firm, corporation, or association of persons, desiring to sell goods, wares or merchandise within this State, shall, before pur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />suing such occupation, pay the tax and take out a license to pursue the occupation of a merchant of the class to which he properly belongs, ac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cording to his annual purchases, as provided by law; and shall file with the tax collector an affidavit of the amount of his annual purchases for the past year, if previously engaged in such business, or part of a year if engaged in such business less than a year, and also of the estimated amount of his annual purchases for the ensuing year. Said affidavit shall be filed and preserved by the tax collector as a part of the records of his office, and shall be in substance as follows, viz.:</p>
<p>The undersigned, as the representative of &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;, doing business at &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;, Texas, do solemnly swear that the estimate made of the annual purchases of said concern of goods, wares and merchandise for the next ensuing year does not exceed &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; thousand dollars.

<p>Sec. 3. No occupation tax receipt or license taken out by a merchant of a lower class than the one to which he properly belongs, shall be any protection against a prosecution and conviction for knowingly pursuing that of a higher class and failing to pay the occupation tax due therefor.</p>
<p>Sec. 4.

<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That section 58 of said act be amended so that hereafter it shall read as follows:</p>
<p>Section 58. White and colored children shall not be taught in the same schools, but impartial provision shall be made, for both races. Three white trustees shall in all cases be elected for the control and management of the white schools of the district, and three colored trus<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tees shall be elected for the control and management of the schools for colored children. The election for white and colored trustees shall be held at the same times and places, and the ballots cast for white trus<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tees shall be deposited in a separate box from that used for the ballots cast for colored trustees.

The returns shall show distinctly the separate votes for white and colored trustees, and the county clerk shall certify to the county superintendent the white and colored trustees elected for each district, and the county superintendent shall issue the commissions of trustees. Each year after the scholastic census of the county is completed, the county superintendent shall, if any district has less than twenty pupils of scholastic age, either white or colored, have authority to consolidate said district as to said white or colored schools with other adjoining dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tricts, and to designate the board of trustees which shall control the white or colored school of such consolidated district. But this shall be done before the apportionment is made, and the apportionment shall be made with respect to such consolidation. The white trustees of each district shall be the trustees of the district for all purposes having relation to the management or control of the white schools, and the fund appor<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tioned for their support, and the colored trustees shall be the trustees for all purposes in reference to the management or control of the col<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ored schools and the funds apportioned for their support. The appor<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tionment to the white and colored schools of each district shall be made in the following manner: The county superintendent, upon the receipt of the certificate issued by the Board of Education for the State fund belonging to his county, shall apportion the same to the several school districts (not including the independent school districts of the county), making a pro rata distribution as per the scholastic census, and shall at the same time apportion the income arising from the county school funds to all the school districts, including the independent school districts of the county, making a pro rata distribution as per scholastic census.

Should they agree upon a division of the funds of the district or upon the length of the term for which the schools of the district shall be maintained, they shall at once certify their agreement to the county superintendent, who shall not approve any contract with teachers of the district until said agreement is received. Should said boards of trustees fail to agree upon a division of the funds of the district or upon the length of the term for which the schools of the district shall be main<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tained, they shall at once certify their disagreement to the county super<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />intendent, who shall proceed to fix the school term of such district and declare the division of the school fund of the district between the white and colored schools therein, endeavoring, as far as practicable, to pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vide for the schools of such district a school term of the same length.</p>

Whereas, the near approach of the new scholastic year creates an emergency and an imperative public necessity that the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days be suspended, and that this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>

<p>Sec. 9.

<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That all cities or towns of one thousand inhabitants or over which have heretofore attempted to accept the provisions of chapter 1, title 17, of the Revised Civil Statutes, and which have attempted to be incorporated under the provisions of said general law, but which said attempted in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />corporation is invalid by reason of the failure of said cities or towns to comply with all the requirements of law relating to the incorporation of towns or villages, but which said cities or towns have from and after the dates of their several efforts to accept the provisions of law relating to the incorporation of cities or towns of one thousand inhabitants or over, exercised the functions of cities or towns of the class named, and been recognized as such cities or towns, he and are hereby declared to be cities of one thousand inhabitants or over, and their incorporation as such is hereby in all things validated: Provided, that nothing in this act shall be held to validate the incorporation of cities or towns that had less than one thousand inhabitants at the time of their attempted incor<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />poration as such cities or towns of one thousand inhabitants or over.</p>

<p>Whereas, the Aransas Pass Harbor Company has arranged with cer<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tain capitalists to furnish the money to secure deep water over the bar at Aransas Pass on the gulf coast of Texas upon certain conditions, among others that said Aransas Pass Harbor Company acquire the title to Harbor Island, situated near said Aransas Pass; and</p>
<p>Whereas, deep water harbors, docks and wharves on the gulf coast of Texas are of great importance to the development and prosperity of the State of Texas and the entire West and Northwest; now, therefore,</p>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That the Aransas Pass Harbor Company shall be permitted to purchase from the State of Texas, at two dollars per acre, Harbor Island, situated near Aransas Pass, on the gulf coast of Texas: Provided, that the sale hereby authorized shall not include the twenty-five acres patented to the United States government for Aransas lighthouse; nor shall it in any way interfere with the State keeping the quarantine station on said island as long as the State desires to do so: And be it further provided, that nothing herein shall be construed to affect any rights acquired before the passage of this act.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. Upon the written application of said Aransas Pass Harbor Company to the Commissioner of the General Land Office, accompanied by one-fifth of the purchase money for said island, together with the field notes and plat officially made by the proper county surveyors, the Commissioner of the General Land Office shall execute his receipt for the money when paid, and plat the field notes upon the maps of his office, and the remainder of said purchase money may be paid thereafter at any time within five years, the deferred payments to bear interest at the rate of five per cent per annum, payable annually, until said purchase money is fully paid. One-half of the proceeds of the sale of said island shall belong to the permanent school fund and one-half to the general revenue of the State. If the said Aransas Pass Harbor Company shall fail to pay the annual interest upon any part of the purchase money when said in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />terest shall become due, or shall fail to pay the principal when the same shall become due, then all rights acquired under the purchase, with all payments made thereon, shall be forfeited without judicial ascertainment of such forfeiture, and the Commissioner of the General Land Office shall endorse upon the contract of purchase that the same is forfeited, whereby all rights so acquired shall be forfeited and revert to the State.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. No patent shall issue to said Aransas Pass Harbor Company for said land purchased and paid for until said company has procured a depth of twenty feet of water at mean gulf tide over the bar of Aransas Pass, nor until the same has been maintained for two years thereafter: Provided, that said company shall obtain a depth of fifteen feet of water at mean gulf tide over said bar by the 15th day of April, A. D. 1896, and twenty feet of water at mean gulf tide over said bar by the 1st day of September, A. D. 1896.</p>

<p>Sec. 4. Should said Aransas Pass Harbor Company fail to obtain fifteen feet of water at mean gulf tide over said bar by said 15th day of April. A. D. 1896, or twenty feet of water at mean gulf tide over said bar by said 1st of September, 1896, or to maintain said last named depth for two years after said depth has been obtained, then said Aransas Pass Harbor Company shall forfeit all purchase money paid and all right to purchase under the provisions of this act. The depth of water over said bar shall be determined at mean gulf tide by the engineer in charge of the work and by a competent engineer appointed by the Governor of the State of Texas, whose joint certificate as to said depths shall be sufficient authority for the Commissioner of the General Land Office to issue the patent to the Aransas Pass Harbor Company, when all purchase money and interest has been paid as provided.</p>
<p>Sec. 5.

<p>Sec. 6.

Such fees shall be paid to the witnesses and the officers serving the process as shall be prescribed by the rules of the house in which said contest is pending, and no mileage or per diem shall be paid to either of the parties to said contest until said case is deter<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mined, and in no case shall any mileage or per diem be paid to any party against whom any contest is decided.</p>
<p>Sec. 31. If the contest be for the validity of an election for Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Comptroller of Public Accounts, Treasurer, Com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioner of the General Land Office or Attorney General, the same shall be tried and determined by both houses of the Legislature in joint ses<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sion, and the provisions of this chapter governing in the case of a con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />test for the validity of an election for members of the Legislature shall apply to and govern in a contest for the offices above named, as far as the same may be applicable.</p>

<p>Sec. 34. All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this act be and are hereby repealed.</p>
<p>Sec. 35. The fact that there is no general law in force in this State regulating contested elections, and the great number of bills now re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quiring the attention of this Legislature, constitute an imperative pub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lic necessity that the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read in each house of the Legislature on three several days be suspended, and said rule is so suspended.</p>

And if any purchaser shall fail to reside upon and improve in good faith the land purchased by him, he shall forfeit said land and all payments made thereon to the State, in the same manner as for non-payment of interest, and such land shall be again for sale as if no such sale and forfeiture had occurred: Provided, that all necessary and temporary absence from such land of such purchaser, for the time of not more than six months in any one year, for the purpose of earning money with which to pay for the land, or for the purpose of schooling his children, shall not work a forfeiture of his title: Provided, further, that nothing in this section contained shall be construed to inhibit the State from instituting such legal pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceedings as may be necessary to enforce such forfeiture, or to recover the full amount of the interest and such penalties as may be due the State at the time such forfeiture occurred, or to protect any other right to such land, which suits may be instituted by the Attorney General or under his direction, in the proper court of the county in which the land lies or of the county to which such county is attached for judicial pur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />poses: Provided, this section shall be printed on the back of the receipt.</p>
<p>Sec. 12. In all cases where persons have purchased or may hereafter purchase State, school or asylum lands under any act of the Legislature authorizing the sale thereof and requiring a residence of three years thereon, and said persons have so resided upon said land or may here<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />after reside thereon for the period of three years as required by law, and their files have been or may hereafter be cancelled and purchases an<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nulled by the Commissioner of the General Land Office on account of conflict with other surveys, said persons shall have the right to purchase other lands of the classes mentioned in this act without being required to reside thereon. Persons desiring to avail themselves of the benefits of this provision shall make satisfactory proof to the Commissioner of the three years residence under their first purchase.</p>
<p>Sec. 13. In all cases where any of the lands mentioned in this act have been heretofore sold under any law authorizing the sale thereof, and the original purchaser shall have sold or may hereafter sell any part of his<pb n="798" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="68" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>purchase in quantities of forty acres or multiples thereof, and the con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />veyance to his vendee or vendees is filed in the General Land Office after having been duly recorded in the proper county, the Commissioner and Treasurer shall credit his account with the value of the land sold, and they shall open up new accounts with the original purchaser and such vendee or vendees, and the Commissioner of the General Land Office shall patent said land to the owners thereof in quantities of forty acres or multiples thereof: Provided, that when any of such land is situated within three miles of a county seat it may be patented in twenty acre tracts.</p>
<p>Sec. 14. The Commissioner of the General Land Office is hereby au<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />thorized to patent in quantities of not less than one nor more than five acres any of the vacant and unappropriated public domain of Texas or any of the lands mentioned in this act as sites for cemeteries, churches or school houses. When the land is desired as a location for a school house, the patent shall issue to the county judge of the proper county and his successors in office in trust for that purpose; and when desired for a church house or a cemetery, it shall be issued to trustees designated by those requesting the patent. If the land has been previously sold by the State and not patented, the owner thereof shall execute a deed there<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />for to the county judge or trustees as the case may be, and cause the same to be recorded in the office of the county clerk of the proper county, and to be filed in the General Land Office, and shall be entitled to credit on his account with the State for the value therefor. Except in case of vacant land the value of the land shall be deposited with the State Treasurer, and in all cases the patent fees shall be paid to the Commissioner of the General Land Office before patent issues. Such land shall be taken from the margin of a tract or section or of a subdi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vision thereof, as the case may be.</p>
<p>Sec. 15. The Commissioner of the General Land Office shall retain in his custody as records of his office all applications, affidavits, obliga<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions and all other papers relating to the sales of said lands, and shall cause to be kept accurate accounts with each purchaser. All purchase money due upon lands, as well as accrued interest, and all other moneys arising from the sales or leases of said lands shall be paid by the pur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />chaser or lessee direct to the Treasurer of the State, who shall cause an accurate account to be kept with each purchaser, and who shall execute duplicate receipts for all sums of money paid to him under the provi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sions of this act, one of which receipts shall be delivered to the pur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />chaser or his agent, and the other transmitted to the Commissioner of the General Land Office.</p>
<p>Sec. 16. The Commissioner of the General Land Office shall adopt such regulations for the sale of the timber on the timbered lands as may be deemed necessary and judicious. Such timber shall not be sold for less than five dollars per acre, cash, except in such cases as the Commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioner may ascertain by definite examinations by an approved agent ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pointed by him for that purpose, to be paid by the purchaser, to be sparsely timbered or containing timber of but little value, in which case he may sell the timber on such sections or part of sections at its proper value: Provided, such timber is sold at not less than two dollars per acre. The purchaser shall have five years from the date of his purchase within which to remove the timber therefrom, and in case of failure to<pb n="799" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="69" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>do so, such timber shall thereby be forfeited to the State without ju<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dicial ascertainment: Provided, that all timbered lands from which the timber has been cut and taken off may be placed on the market and sold as agricultural or grazing lands, according to the classifications to be made by the Land Commissioner: Provided, that the purchaser or his vendees of any such timber shall have the right to purchase the land upon which such timber so purchased is situated at two dollars per acre, cash, at any time before the expiration of five years from date of purchase of timber under the provisions of this act.</p>
<p>Sec. 17. The public lands and all lands referred to in the several funds mentioned in this act shall be leased by the Commissioner of the General Land Office under the provisions of this act. All lands classi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fied as agricultural and all lands containing permanent water thereon shall be leased for a term of five years or less at not less than three cents per acre per annum, and all lands classified as pasture or dry grazing lands shall be leased for a term of not more than ten years at not less than two cents per acre per annum, which rental shall be paid yearly in advance, the first payment to be made at the time the lease contract is entered into. If at the termination of any lease the lands covered thereby are still for lease the lessee thereof shall have the preference right to again lease such lands theretofore leased by him upon the terms and at the prices then fixed by law. All leases shall be executed under the hand and seal of the Land Commissioner and delivered to the lessee or his duly authorized agent, and such lease shall not take effect until the first annual rental is paid, and such lease thereof duly filed for record in the clerk&#8217;s office of the proper county, and it shall not be necessary for the Commissioner to acknowledge such lease contract so signed and delivered; and all leases under the provisions of this act shall be adver<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tised by the Commissioner in such manner as he may think best, and let to the highest responsible bidder in such quantities and under such regulations as he may think to the best interest of the State, not in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />consistent with the equities of the occupant. All bids and offers to lease may be rejected by him prior to signing the lease contract, for fraud or collusion, or other good and sufficient cause.</p>
<p>Sec. 18. Any person desiring to lease any portion of the lands be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />longing to any of the funds mentioned in this act shall make application in writing to the Commissioner of the General Land Office, specifying and describing the particular lands he desires to lease, and thereupon the Commissioner, if satisfied that the lands applied for are not in im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mediate demand for purposes of actual settlement, shall notify the applicant in writing that his proposition to lease is accepted, and there<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />upon he shall execute and deliver to the lessee, in the name and by the authority of the State of Texas, a lease of said land for such term as may be agreed upon, and deliver the same to such lessee when satisfied that the lessee has paid to the Treasurer of the State the rent for one year in advance. No lands which are now or may hereafter be classified as grazing or pasture lands shall be subject to sale, nor shall the possession thereof by the lessee be disturbed during the term of such lease, except as herein provided, so long as the rents are paid promptly in advance each year, as required by this act. Any ac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tual settler upon any of the lands mentioned in this act, being the head of a family, shall have the right to buy at any time not more than three additional sections of strictly pasture lands, notwith<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="800" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="70" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>standing any lease thereof, unless by some other actual settler, the head of a family, leasing not more than three sections. Whenever any lease<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />holder has leased from the State of Texas exceeding ten sections, any actual settler, being the head of a family, shall have the right to lease within a radius of five miles of the land occupied by him not exceeding three sections of the land held by such larger leaseholder, but shall not be allowed thereby to reduce the larger leasehold to less than ten sec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions: Provided, that any man not the head of a family shall have this preference right to lease three sections after having, placed two hundred dollars worth of improvements on the section purchased by him: Pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided, that in all cases where the actual settler having purchased one section of land is permitted by the provisions of this section to buy or lease additional lands, and thus terminate the lease of the larger lease<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />holder, he shall be required to so select such additional lands sought to be purchased or leased by him as that by an exchange of lands, section for section and acre for acre, of like quality and class with the larger leaseholder, he can secure the quantity of land he desires to purchase or lease in a solid body; and in case the larger leaseholder desires to do so the actual settler so purchasing or leasing the additional lands in this section mentioned shall make such exchange with him, and shall be re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quired to fence the same separate and apart from the lands of the larger leaseholder; but in no case shall the actual settler be allowed to purchase or lease the lands and terminate the lease of the larger leaseholder under the provisions of this section upon which there is a permanent natural or artificial water supply; and in no case shall such actual settler be permitted to so select such additional lands for purchase or lease as that by an exchange of lands with the larger leaseholder such larger lease<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />holder will be required to give in exchange any lands upon which there may be a permanent natural or artificial water supply, or upon which there may be improvements of the value of two hundred dollars. In case the larger leaseholder does not desire to exchange lands, as herein pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided, with the actual settler, or upon request made by such actual settler refuses to do so within a reasonable time, then he shall not be required to fence his land, but may turn loose inside of any inclosure in which his lands may be situated not more than one head of cattle or horses, or in lieu thereof four head of sheep or goats, for every ten acres of land so purchased or leased by him: Provided further, that nothing herein shall be construed so as to prevent either lessee from fencing his own land from the other if he should desire to do so, or to require the small leaseholder to fence his lands at all unless the larger leaseholder shall have his leasehold fenced: And provided further, that nothing in this section shall be so construed as to permit any actual settler, either by purchase or lease, or by both, to terminate the lease of the larger leaseholder upon more than four sections: And provided further, that north of a line extending west from the southeast corner of Callahan county to the southeast corner of Martin county; thence north to the south line of Lynn county; thence west to the southwest corner of Lynn county; thence north to the south line of Castro county; thence west to the line of Hew Mexico, the settler exercising the preference right herein given to buy or lease within the enclosure of another may so buy or lease any lands except a section on which there are improvements of the value of two hundred dollars, or on which there is a permanent artificial water supply, and shall not be required to enclose his lands separate from the<pb n="801" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="71" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>lands of the larger leaseholder unless he can obtain the full amount of four sections in a solid body, or unless the same can be secured in a solid body by exchange of lands for the term for which he leases, section for section or acre for acre, with the larger leaseholder; and in all cases where he is not required by the provisions of this act to enclose his lands he may turn loose not more than one head of horses or cattle, or in lieu thereof four head of sheep or goats, for every ten acres of land purchased or leased by him and unenclosed. Each violation of the pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />visions of this act which restricts the number of stock that may be turned loose on lands leased from the State shall be an offense, and the offender, on conviction, shall be punished by fine of one dollar for each head of stock he may so turn loose, and each thirty days violation of the provisions of this section shall constitute a separate offense. Any agricultural land that may be leased by an actual settler shall be subject to sale and settlement, but in case his lease does not embrace more than three sections, only on condition that the purchaser enclose with posts and at least two wires the land purchased by him separate from the land held by the lessee, and failure to so enclose it within three months from the date of the purchase shall be sufficient cause to authorize the Commissioner to cancel the contract of purchase and reinstate the lease. In all cases where the lease is terminated under any of the provisions hereof, before the expiration of the term of lease, the lessee shall have a pro rata credit upon his next year&#8217;s rent, or the money refunded to him by the Treasurer, as he may elect. On the expiration of his lease or its termination under any provision of this section the lessee shall have the right for a period of sixty days to remove any or all the im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />provements he shall have placed upon the leased premises.</p>
<p>Sec. 19. Any person desiring to lease any portion of the lands afore<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />said on which no permanent water supply exists, shall notify the Com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioner of the General Land Office in writing that he desires to lease lands, specifying and describing them, provided he can obtain the neces<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sary supply of water by boring or otherwise, and that he will within ninety days lease said lands, provided such water supply can be obtained; he shall also make and file with the Commissioner of the General Land Office his bond, with good and sufficient personal security in a sum equal to one year&#8217;s rental of the quantity of land applied for, payable to the State of Texas, conditioned that he will diligently and in good faith try to secure water on such land during such ninety days, and if secured will lease the designated lands for the term prescribed herein, and thereupon the Commissioner shall for such ninety days withhold the lands thus designated from lease to any other person; within or at the expiration of said ninety days and annually thereafter such applicant to lease shall pay to the State of Texas, in advance, one year&#8217;s rental of the land applied for by him, on satisfactory proof of which payment the Commissioner shall execute and deliver to the lessee a lease of the said lands, signed by himself officially and attested by the seal of the Land Office, together with which he shall deliver up the bond of said lessee, marked &#8220;Satis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fied.&#8221; If the said lessee shall fail to apply for his lease and make the payment aforesaid within said ninety days, and shall also within said ninety days fail to make proof to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of the General Land Office within that time that he has in good faith and diligently used proper means and expended proper efforts to secure a<pb n="802" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="72" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>water supply on such land and failed, then and in that case the Commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioner shall mark said bond &#8220;Forfeited,&#8221; and shall deliver the same to the Attorney General of the State, who shall at once cause the said bond to be sued upon and collected; and such collection shall become a part of the available school fund. The penalty stated in such bond is hereby declared to be liquidated damages, and judgment for that sum shall in all cases be recovered by the State. Proof satisfactory to the Commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioner of the General Land Office that proper, suitable and diligent ef<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fort had been made by such applicant to secure water, and that suffi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cient water could not be secured, shall relieve the principal and sureties on said bond from all responsibility therein, and it shall be marked &#8220;Satisfied&#8221; by said Commissioner and delivered to the principal therein. No lease of less than four sections of unwatered pasture lands shall be made unless such less number includes all unleased land in that vicinity belonging to the several funds mentioned in this act. Lessees or their vendees who shall have at their own expense secured water on their leaseholds in accordance with the provisions of this section shall, at the expiration of their lease contract, have the right to a renewal of their leases for another term of five years at the price then provided by law, by giving sixty days written notice to the Commissioner, as provided in the preceding section.</p>
<p>Sec. 20. All lessees from the State of lands named in this act, who are one year or more in arrears on their contracts for rent, shall have the right for the period of four months from the time this act shall go into effect, but not longer, within which they may execute and deliver to the Commissioner of the General Land Office their respective obligations in writing, with personal security satisfactory to the Commissioner, for the respective sums of money then owing by them to the State; and on de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />livery of such obligation to the Commissioner and the cash payment of one year&#8217;s rental in advance, they shall have the right to have their lease contracts cancelled, and may lease such lands anew under this act. Such obligation shall bind such lessees to pay said sums of money, one-third in one year, one-third in two years, and the remainder in three years from date, and shall draw six per cent interest per annum, payable an<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nually; and thereupon the Commissioner shall balance their accounts on the books of his office and cancel and deliver up their old leases and make to them new leases under this act. All lessees who are not in ar<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />rears for rent or who shall pay all indebtedness on leases, have the right to surrender their present leases and lease anew their said lands under this act.</p>
<p>Sec. 21. All lessees shall pay the annual rents due for leased lands directly to the Treasurer of the State, who shall execute receipts in du<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />plicate for each payment made by any lessee, one of which receipts shall be delivered to the lessee and the other transmitted to the Commissioner of the General Land Office. The Treasurer shall cause to be kept an ac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />curate account with each lessee, and the Commissioner of the General Land Office shall file in his office all applications and other papers re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lating to leases, and keep a record of all leases made, which papers shall constitute a part of the records of his office.</p>
<p>Sec. 22. If any lessee shall fail to pay the annual rent due in advance for any year within sixty days after such rents shall become due, the Commissioner of the General Land Office may declare such lease can<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />celled by a writing under his hand and seal of office, which writing shall<pb n="803" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="73" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>be filed with the other papers relating to such lease, and thereupon such lease shall immediately terminate, and the lands so leased shall become subject to purchase or lease under the provisions of this act. Such lease shall not be made to original lessees until all arrears are fully paid. During the continuance of all leases, and after forfeiture, the State shall have a lien upon all property owned by the lessee upon the leased prem<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ises to secure the payment of all rents due, which lien shall be superior to all other liens whatsoever; and it shall not be essential to the preser<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vation or validity of such lien that it shall be reserved in the instrument of lease.</p>
<p>Sec. 23. Lessees shall have the right at any time to purchase their leased lands, subject to the limitations as to quantity provided by this act, and at the price and on the conditions herein provided, without reference to any improvements made on such lands by such lessees; and all improvements made by lessees on lands leased by them are hereby declared to be personal property, which may be removed by such lessees on the expiration of their lease contracts; and they shall have sixty days after such expiration in which to remove the same.</p>
<p>Sec. 24. If the Governor shall at any time be informed upon the affi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />davit of some credible person that any portion of the public lands or the lands belonging to any of the several funds named in this act have been enclosed, or that fences have been erected thereon without authority of law, he is authorized in his discretion to direct the Attorney General to institute suit in the name of the State for the recovery of such lands and damages, and a fee of not less than ten dollars for the attorney when the sum recovered is less than one hundred dollars, and when it is over that sum the fee shall be ten per cent, to be paid by the defendant for the use and occupancy of the same, and the removal of such enclosures and fences and such damages shall not be for a less sum than the amount of all the leases due during such occupancy. Such suit may be instituted in the district court of the judicial district in which the land or any portion thereof [is] situated; and upon application of the Attorney General and without affidavit or bond the court in which suit is pending shall issue a writ of sequestration directed to any sheriff of the State, commanding and requiring such officer to take such land and all property thereon be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />longing to the person or persons so unlawfully occupying said land into his actual custody, and hold the same subject to the further orders of the court. Such writ of sequestration may be executed by any sheriff of the State into whose hands it may be delivered, and it shall be the duty of any sheriff into whose hands it may come to proceed and execute such writ. The defendant in such suit may replevy as in ordinary cases by giv<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing bond as prescribed by law, and such cases shall have precedence on the docket and stand for trial before all other cases; and in case judgment is recovered by the State in such suit, the court shall order such enclos<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ures or fences to be removed and shall tax the costs of the suit, if any, against the defendant; and all property found upon the land belonging to the defendant, not exempt from execution, shall be liable to the pay<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment of such costs and damages in addition to the personal liability of the defendant. Appeals may be prosecuted from all judgments in such cases as in ordinary cases, except that the State shall not be required to give bond to perfect its appeal, and such cases on appeal shall have pre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cedence over all other cases. If any person shall make a lease contract, and after the same is enclosed by fence shall for any cause decide not to<pb n="804" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="74" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>continue payment of his lease, either in whole or in part, he shall give public notice by publication in any local paper having title largest circu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lation, for at least sixty days before the time in which his next annual payment shall become due, that he will not continue his lease after the year for which payment is made, and shall also state the number and block of the land which he will not lease inside his enclosure, if he only intends to surrender a part of his lease, and shall post and keep posted for said sixty days notices on all the gates of his pasture of such inten<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion; then, and then only, he shall not be subject to the suit nor be liable for the damages provided for in this section.</p>
<p>Sec. 25. It shall be unlawful for any person to fence, use, occupy or appropriate by herding or line riding, any portion of the public lands of the State, or of the lands belonging to any particular fund specified in this act, without having first obtained a lease of such lands in accord<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ance with the provisions of this act. Any person, whether owner of stock, manager, agent, employee or servant, who shall fence, use, oc<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cupy or appropriate by herding or line riding any portion of such lands without a lease thereof, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall, upon conviction, be fined not less than one hundred nor more than one thousand dollars, and in addition thereto shall be imprisoned in the county jail for a period of not less than three months nor more than two years. Each day of such fencing, occupying, using or appropriating by herding or line riding shall be deemed a separate offence, and any person so offending may be prosecuted by indictment or information in the proper court of the county where any portion of the land lies, or to which it may be attached for judicial purposes, or in the county of Travis, and jurisdiction of such offences is hereby vested in said courts; and in case any indictment or information is preferred or filed against a non-resident of this State for a violation of this article, it shall be the duty of the Governor to demand the extradition of the defendant from the proper officer of any State or Territory where he may be found, in order that he may be brought to trial. &#8220;Fencing,&#8221; within the meaning of this article, is the erection of any structure of wood, wire or both, or any other material intended to prevent the passage of cattle, horses, mules, asses, sheep, goats or hogs, whether the same shall enclose lands on all sides or be erected on one or more sides. Any appropriation of land belonging to any particular fund specified in this act or of the pub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lic lands of this State, without having first obtained a lease thereof, by fencing of any kind, or by enclosures consisting partly of fencing and partly of natural obstacles or impediments to the passage of live stock, shall be deemed an unlawful appropriation punishable as provided in this article for appropriating such lands, and each day said land is ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />propriated shall be deemed a separate offense.</p>
<p>Sec. 26. The Commissioner of the General Land Office may withhold from lease any agricultural lands necessary for purposes of settlement; and no agricultural lands shall be leased if in the judgment of the Com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioner they may be in immediate demand for settlement, but such lands shall be held for settlement and sold to actual settlers only under the provisions of this act; and all sections or fractions of sections in all counties organized prior to the first day of January, 1875, except El Paso, Pecos and Presidio counties, which sections are detached and iso<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lated from other public lands, may be sold to any purchaser except to a<pb n="805" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="75" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>corporation, without actual settlement, at not less than two dollars per acre, upon such terms as the Commissioner of the General Land Office may prescribe.</p>
<p>Sec. 27. All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this act are hereby repealed.</p>
<p>Sec. 28. The inadequate provisions under the present law for support of the public free schools and the necessitous condition of the available school fund creates an emergency and an imperative public necessity that the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days be suspended, and that this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>

All lands classified as agricultural and all lands containing permanent water thereon shall be leased for a term of five years or less, and all lands classified as pastoral or dry grazing lands shall be leased for a term of not more than ten years, and the rental shall be paid yearly in advance, the first payment to be made at the time the lease contract is entered into. If at the termination of any lease the lands covered thereby are still for lease, the lessee thereof shall have the<pb n="806" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="76" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>preference right to again lease such lands theretofore leased by him upon the terms and at the price then fixed by law. All leases shall be exe<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cuted under the hand and seal of the Land Commissioner and delivered to the lessee or his duly authorized agent, and such lease shall not take effect until the first annual rental is paid and such lease thereof duly filed for record in the clerk&#8217;s office of the proper county, and it shall not be necessary for the Commissioner to acknowledge such lease contract so signed and delivered; and all leases under the provisions of this act may be advertised by the Commissioner in such manner as he may think best, and let to the highest responsible bidder in such quantities and under such regulations as he may think to the best interest of the State not inconsistent with the equities of the occupant. All bids and offers to lease may be rejected by him prior to signing the lease contract, for fraud or collusion or other good and sufficient cause.</p>
<p>Section 24. If the Governor shall at any time be credibly informed That any portion of the public lands or the lands belonging to any of the several funds named in this act have been enclosed or that fences have been erected thereon without authority of law, he is authorized in his dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cretion to direct the Attorney General to institute suit in the name of the State for the recovery of such lands and damages, and a fee of not less than ten dollars for the attorney when the sum recovered is less, than one hundred dollars, and when it is over that sum the fee shall be ten per cent, to be paid by the defendant for the use and occupancy of the same, and the removal of such enclosures and fences; and such damages shall not be for a less sum than the amount of all the leases due during such occupancy. For the recovery by the State of all lands sold under the provisions of this or former laws which have been or may hereafter be forfeited to the State for any reason, and for the recovery of any money due the States on leases made under this or former laws, and for the recovery of damages for the unlawful use and occupancy of such lands, as provided in this section, or any former laws, jurisdiction is expressly conferred on the courts of Travis county having jurisdiction thereof under the Constitution concurrently with courts of the districts in which the land is situated, and all such suits shall be instituted by the Attorney General or under his direction. In suits provided for in this section, the court shall issue a writ of sequestration directed to any sheriff of the State, commanding and requiring such officer to take such land and all property thereon belonging to the person or persons so un<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lawfully occupying said lands into his actual custody, and hold the same subject to further orders of the court, and the State shall not be re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quired to give bond. Such writ of sequestration may be executed by any sheriff of the State into whose hands it may be delivered, and it shall be the duty of any sheriff into whose hands it may come to proceed and execute such writ. The defendant in such suit may replevy as in ordinary cases by giving bond as prescribed by law, and such cases shall have prece<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dence on the docket and stand for trial before all other cases; and in case judgment is recovered by the State in such suit the court shall order such enclosure or fences to be removed, and shall tax the costs of the suit against the defendant, and all property found upon the land belonging to the defendant, not exempt from execution, shall be liable to the pay<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment of such costs and damages in addition to the personal liability of the defendant. Appeals may be prosecuted from all judgments in such<pb n="807" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="77" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>cases as in ordinary cases, except that the State shall not be required to give bond to perfect its appeal, and such cases on appeal shall have pre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cedence over all other cases. If any person shall make a lease contract, and after the same is inclosed by fence shall for any cause decide not to continue payment of his lease, either in whole or in part, he shall give public notice by publication in any local paper having the largest circu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lation, for at least sixty days before the time in which his next annual payment shall become due, that he will not continue his lease after the year for which payment is made, and shall also state the number and block of the land which he will not lease inside his inclosure, if he only intends to surrender a part of his lease, and shall post and shall keep posted for said sixty days notice on all gates of his pasture of such inten<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion; then, and then only, he shall not be subject to the suit nor liable for the damages provided for in this section.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. The inadequate provisions of the present laws in reference to the support of the public free schools and the necessitous condition of the available school fund creates an emergency and an imperative public necessity that the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days be suspended, and that this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>

</opener>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That articles 4606, 4607 and 4608 of title XCIII, chapter 4, of the Re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vised Civil Statutes of the State of Texas be amended so to hereafter read as follows:</p>
<p>Article 4606. Any owner, lessee, or person in lawful possession of enclosed lands shall be entitled to the following fees for impounding stock, to-wit: ten cents per day per head for hogs, ten cents per day per head for goats, and five cents per head per day for sheep. The damages done by such stock, if any, and the fees due to the taker up of stock, if any, may be assessed by any three disinterested freeholders of the sub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />division in which said stock is taken up, who shall upon the application of the taker up of the stock be appointed by the justice of the peace of the precinct in which such subdivision is situated. Where said justice shall fail or refuse to make appointment, or where the stock law has been adopted by an entire county, said freeholders shall be appointed by the county judge of the county. Said freeholders after being duly sworn to discharge with impartiality the duties devolving upon them by said appointment, shall proceed after hearing the evidence to, determine whether or not any trespass, prohibited by the provisions of this chapter has been committed, and to ascertain the damages, if any, occasioned thereby, and the fees due to the taker up of the stock by reason of said trespass, and shall make an assessment of damages and fees, in writing, and signed by said freeholders, or two of them, and verified by the affi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />davit of said freeholders, to the effect that said assessment is just and that they have no bias in favor of or prejudice against any party inter<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ested therein, and shall file said assessment with the justice of the peace, which shall be final: Provided, that the owner of the stock, if known, shall have five days notice of the time and place of the meeting of said freeholders, and if the owner is unknown then a written notice thereof shall be posted in two public places in said subdivision and one at the door of the court house of the county: And provided further, that noth<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing in this chapter shall be construed to deprive the taker up of the stock to enforce by suit in a court of competent jurisdiction any claim he may have for such fees and damages, and to subject the stock so taken for the payment of the same under the provisions of this chapter.</p>
<p>Article 4607. After the filing of the assessment, as provided for in the preceding article, the constable of the precinct shall sell such stock at public auction for cash, after having given notice of such sale as in constables&#8217; sales of personal property, and apply the proceeds of such sale, after deducting the expenses thereof, to the satisfaction of said fees and damages, and shall pay the balance, if any remains, to the owner of such stock. The justices and constables shall receive for their services the same compensation as is allowed for like services in civil cases.</p>
<p>Article 4608. If no owner can be found of stock so impounded, the taker up may make affidavit before a justice of the peace of the county,<pb n="815" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="85" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>describing the stock impounded by him, and that the owner is unknown to affiant, which affidavit shall be forthwith delivered to the county clerk by such justice, to be kept in his office for inspection. After the filing of such assessment, the constable of the precinct shall sell such stock as in case where the owner is known, and if anything remains after satisfying the expenses of said sale and the fees and damages due to the taker up, he shall report the same under oath to the clerk of the county court, and pay the same over to the county treasurer, to be received and disbursed by him as in case of sales of estrays, or the taker up may at his option, after the expiration of five days, estray such stock, according to the laws regulating estrays in this State.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. Whereas, the Supreme Court of the State of Texas having de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />clared certain sections of the stock law unconstitutional, the effect of which is to leave the State without a sufficient stock law, and the near approach of the close of the session creates an imperative public neces<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sity and emergency which authorizes the suspension of the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days, and the same is hereby suspended, and this law be and hereby declared to be in effect from and after its passage.</p>

<opener>
<salute>An act to provide for the amicable adjustment of grievances and disputes that may arise between employers or receiver and employes, and to authorize the creation of a board of arbitration; to provide for compensation of said board, and to provide penalties for the violation hereof.</salute>
</opener>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That whenever any grievence or dispute of any nature, growing out of the re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lation of employer and employes, shall arise or exist between employer and employes, it shall be lawful, upon mutual consent of all parties, to submit all matters respecting such grievance or dispute in writing to a board of arbitrators to hear, adjudicate, and determine the same. Said board shall consist of five (5) persons. When the employes concerned in<pb n="816" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="86" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>such grievance or dispute as the aforesaid are members in good standing of any labor organization which is represented by one or more delegates in a central body, the said central body shall have power to designate two (2) of said arbitrators, and the employer shall have the power to designate two (2) others of said arbitrators, and the said four arbitrators shall designate a fifth person as arbitrator, who shall be chairman of the board. In case the employes concerned in any such grievance or dispute as aforesaid are members in good standing of a labor organization which is not represented in a central body, then the organization of which they are members shall designate two members of said board, and said board shall be organized as hereinbefore provided; and in case the employes concerned in any such grievance or dispute as aforesaid are not members of any labor organization, then a majority of said employes, at a meet<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing duly held for that purpose, shall designate two arbitrators for said board, and said board shall be organized as hereinbefore provided: Pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided, that when the two arbitrators selected by the respective parties to the controversy, the district judge of the district having jurisdiction of the subject matter shall, upon notice from either of said arbitrators that they have failed to agree upon the fifth arbitrator, appoint said fifth arbi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />trator.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. That any board as aforesaid selected may present a petition in writing to the district judge of the county where such grievance or dispute to be arbitrated may arise, signed by a majority of said board, setting forth in brief terms the facts showing their due and regular ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pointment, and the nature of the grievance or dispute between the par<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ties to said arbitration, and praying the license or order of such judge establishing and approving of said board of arbitration. Upon the pre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sentation of said petition it shall be the duty of said judge, if it appear that all requirements of this act have been complied with, to make an order establishing such board of arbitration and referring the matters in dispute to it for hearing, adjudication and determination. The said petition and order, or a copy thereof, shall be filed in the office of the dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />trict clerk of the county in which the arbitration is sought.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. That when a controversy involves and affects the interests of two or more classes or grades of employees belonging to different labor organizations, or of individuals who are not members of a labor organ<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ization, then the two arbitrators selected by the employees shall be agreed upon and selected by the concurrent action of all such labor or<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ganizations, and a majority of such individuals who are not members of a labor organization.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. The submission shall be in writing, shall be signed by the em<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ployer or receiver and the labor organisation representing the employees, or any laborer or laborers to be affected by such arbitration who may not belong to any labor organization, shall state the question to be decided, and shall contain appropriate provisions by which the respective parties shall stipulate as follows:</p>
<p>1. That pending the arbitration the existing status prior to any dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />agreement or strike shall not be changed.</p>
<p>2. That the award shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />trict court of the county in which said board of arbitration is held, and shall be final and conclusive upon both parties, unless set aside for error of law, apparent on the record.</p>
<p>3. That the respective parties to the award will each faithfully execute<pb n="817" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="87" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>the same, and that the same may be specifically enforced in equity so far as the powers of a court of equity permit.</p>
<p>4. That the employees dissatisfied with the award shall not by reason of such dissatisfaction, quit the service of said employer or receiver be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fore the expiration of thirty days, nor without giving said employer or receiver thirty days written notice of their intention so to quit.</p>
<p>5. That said award shall continue in force as between the parties thereto for the period of one year after the same shall go into practical operation, and no new arbitration upon the same subject between the same parties shall be had until the expiration of said one year.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. That the arbitrators so selected shall sign a consent to act as such and shall take and subscribe an oath before some officer authorized to administer the same to faithfully and impartially discharge his duties as such arbitrator, which consent and oath shall be immediately filed in the office of the clerk of the district court wherein such arbitrators are to act. When said board is ready for the transaction of business it shall select one of its members to act as secretary and the parties to the dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pute shall receive notice of a time and place of hearing, which shall be not more than ten days after such agreement to arbitrate has been filed.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. The chairman, shall have power to administer oaths and to issue subpoenas for the production of books and papers and for the at<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tendance of witnesses to the same extent that such power is possessed by the court of record or the judge thereof in this State. The board may make and enforce the rules for its government and transaction of the business before it and fix its sessions and adjournment, and shall herein examine such witnesses as may be brought before the board, and such other proof as may be given relative to the matter in dispute.</p>
<p>Sec. 7. That when said board shall have rendered its adjudication and determination its powers shall cease, unless there may be at the time in existence other similar grievances or disputes between the same class of persons mentioned in section 1, and in such case such persons may submit their differences to said board, which shall have power to act and adjudicate and determine the same as fully as if said board was originally created for the settlement of such difference or differences.</p>
<p>Sec. 8. That during the pendency of arbitration under this act it shall not be lawful for the employer or receiver party to such arbitra<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion, nor his agent, to discharge the employees parties thereto, except for inefficiency, violation of law, or neglect of duty, or where reduction of force is necessary, nor for the organization representing such em<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ployees to order, nor for the employees to unite in, aid or abet strikes or boycots against such employer or receiver.</p>
<p>Sec. 9. That each of the said board of arbitrators shall receive three dollars per day for every day in actual service, not to exceed ten (10) days, and travelling expenses not to exceed five cents per mile actually traveled in getting to or returning from the place where the board is in session. That the fees of witnesses of aforesaid board shall be fifty cents for each day&#8217;s attendance and five cents per mile traveled by the nearest route to and returning from the place where attendance is required by the board. All subpoenas shall be signed by the secretary of the board and may be served by any person of full age authorized by the board to serve the same. That the fees and mileage of witnesses and the per diem, and traveling ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />penses of said arbitrators shall be taxed as costs against either or all<pb n="818" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="88" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>of the parties to said arbitration, as the board of arbitrators may deem just, and shall constitute part of their award, and each of the parties to said arbitration shall, before the arbitration [arbitrators] proceed to consider the matters submitted to them, give a bond, with two or more good and sufficient sureties in an amount to be fixed by the board of ar<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />bitration, conditioned for the payment of all the expenses connected with the said arbitration.</p>
<p>Sec. 10. That the award shall be made in triplicate. One copy shall be filed in the district clerk&#8217;s office, one copy shall be given to the em<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ployer or receiver, and one copy to the employees or their duly author<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ized representative. That the award being filed in the clerk&#8217;s office of the district court as hereinbefore provided, shall go into practical oper<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ation and judgment shall be entered thereon accordingly at the expira<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion of ten days from such filing, unless within such ten days either party shall file exceptions thereto for matter of law apparent on the record, in which case said award shall go into practical operation and judgment rendered accordingly when such exceptions shall have been fully disposed of by either said district court or on appeal therefrom.</p>
<p>Sec. 11. At the expiration of ten days from the decision of the dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />trict court upon exceptions taken to said award as aforesaid, judgment shall be entered in accordance with said decision, unless during the said ten days either party shall appeal therefrom to the Court of Civil Ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />peals holding jurisdiction thereof. In such case only such portion of the record shall be transmitted to the appellate court as is necessary to the proper understanding and consideration of the questions of law presented by said exceptions and to be decided. The determination of said Court of Civil Appeals upon said questions shall be final, and being certified by the clerk of said Court of Civil Appeals, judgment pursuant thereto shall thereupon be entered by said district court. If exceptions to an award are finally sustained, judgment shall be entered setting<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />aside the award; but in such case the parties may agree upon a judgment to be entered disposing of the subject matter of the controversy, which judgment, when entered, shall have the same force and effect as judg<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment entered upon an award.</p>
<p>Sec. 12. The near approach of the end of the session, and the great number of bills requiring the attention of the Legislature, creates an imperative public necessity and an emergency that the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read in each house on three several days be sus<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pended, and it is so suspended.</p>

<opener>
<salute>An act to provide for the organization and con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />trol of school districts lying partly within two or more counties, and school communities composed of persons living within two or more counties.</salute>
</opener>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That whenever the people living near a county line desire to organize a school district lying partly within two or more counties, a petition set<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ting forth the boundaries of the proposed district, signed by a majority of the qualified voters within said boundaries and approved by the county superintendent (or ex officio county superintendent) of public instruction of each county in which any part of the proposed district lies, shall be presented to the commissioners court of any of one of said counties, and said commissioners court shall have authority to es<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tablish such school district according to said petition.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. When such school district is so established it shall be re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />garded and treated in all respects as a district of the county by whose commissioners court it is established: Provided, that the children of scholastic age living in each county shall be reported separately to the proper county authorities and apportionments for such pupils shall be made by the several counties as to other children of the same counties, but the funds apportioned to such children shall all be transferred dur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing each school year to the county whose comissioners court estab<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lished the district: And provided, further, that when any such school district authorizes the levy of a local school tax by vote of tax payers the returns of the election shall be made to the commissioners court of the county establishing the district, and when the result of the election is declared the county clerk shall transmit to the commissioners court of each of the other counties interested notice of the result and of the rate of tax, if any, authorized. And the commissioners court of each county shall levy, the assessor shall assess, and the collector shall col<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lect the tax separately for the portions of the district in their respec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tive counties, but the funds so derived shall all be transferred to the county whose commissioners court established the district.</p>
<p>Sec. 3.

<p>Sec. 4.

<salute>An act authorizing counties and cities to erect bridges in incorporated cities, or to co-operate with cities in the erection thereof.</salute>
</opener>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That whenever the commissioners court of any county shall deem it to the interest of the county to erect any bridge or bridges within the corporate limits of any city or town, said court may make contracts therefor, and erect said bridges to the same extent and under the same conditions now prescribed by law for the construction of bridges out<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />side of the limits of any city of town.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. If said commissioners court and the city council of any city or town desire to co-operate in the erection of a bridge within the corporate limits of any city of town, they may jointly erect such bridge upon such terms and conditions as may be mutually agreed upon; and either or both of the city and county may issue its bonds to pay for its proportional part of the debt: Provided, that no such contract shall be made or entered into or bonds issued under the provisions of this act unless a proposition therefor shall be sub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mitted to the property tax paying voters of the county at an elec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion to be held by virtue of an order of the commissioners court for the purpose, and a majority of such voters shall vote at such election<pb n="895" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="165" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>in favor of such proposition; and the same laws governing other elections shall govern said election, canvass and return, and the county judge of said county shall declare by proclamation the result thereof by publica<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion in some newspaper in said county.</p>

<p>Sec. 4.

D.: Provided, however, that a substantial compliance with the above form shall be deemed sufficient to fix and se<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cure the lien.)</p>
<p>Section 7. When a contract or account is filed and recorded as re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quired by the preceding section of this act, it shall be deemed sufficient diligence to fix and secure this lien. If this lien is against land in a city, town or village, it shall extend to or into the lot or lots upon which such house, building or improvement is situated, or upon which such labor was performed; and if the lien is against land in the country, it shall extend to and include fifty acres upon which such house, building or improvements is situated, or upon which such labor has been performed; and if the lien is against a railroad company, it shall extend to and in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />clude all of its property.</p>
<p>Section 8. The lien herein provided for shall attach to the house, building, improvements or railroad for which they were furnished, or the work was done, in preference to any prior lien or encumbrance or mortgage upon the land upon which the houses, buildings or improve<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments, or railroad have been put, or labor performed, and the person enforcing the same may have such house, building or improvement, or any piece of the railroad property sold separately: Provided, any lien, encumbrance or mortgage on the land or improvement at the time of the inception of the lien herein provided for shall not be affected thereby, and holders of such liens need not be made parties in suits to foreclose liens herein provided for.</p>
<p>Section 9. When the house, building, improvement, or any piece of the<pb n="927" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="197" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>railroad&#8217;s property are sold separately, the officers making the sale shall place the purchaser in possession thereof, and such purchaser shall have the right to remove the same within a reasonable time from the date of the purchase.</p>
<p>Sec. 10. Whereas, there is now no law on the statute books extend<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing the material man&#8217;s lien to railroads; and whereas, the crowded con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dition of the calendar and the approach to the end of the session creates an emergency and imperative public necessity that the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days be suspended, and this bill be put on its third reading and final passage, and it is enacted that it be so suspended.</p>
<p>[Note.&#8212;The foregoing act was presented to the Governor of Texas for his approval on the 29th clay of April, A.

<salute>An act to better and more fully promote the de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />velopment of the mining resources of Texas, and to repeal all laws in conflict with the provisions of this act.</salute>
</opener>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That all public school, university, asylum and public lands specially in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cluded under the operation of this act, all the lands now owned by the State situated within the reservation known as the &#8220;Pacific Reserva<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion,&#8221; which were taken off the market and reserved from sale by an act approved January 22, 1883, containing valuable mineral deposits, are hereby reserved from sale or other disposition, except as herein pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided, and are declared free and open to exploration and purchase under regulations prescribed by law, by citizens of the United States and those who have declared their intention of becoming such: Provided, that all who have located and recorded valid claims under previous valid laws and have not abandoned same, but are engaged in developing same, shall have a prior preference right for ninety days after the passage of this act in which to relocate same under this act.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. It shall be the duty of the Commissioner of the General Land Office immediately upon the passage of this act to have a map made showing the location of all public school, university, asylum and public lands which are unsold at that date, and it shall be the duty of the Geo<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />logical and Mineralogical Survey to examine all such lands as soon as practicable thereafter, and to designate such tracts as are apparently min<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />eral bearing as mineral lands for the purposes of this act. If mineral lands are afterwards claimed to exist at other locations than are so desig<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nated they shall also be examined and classified accordingly.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. It shall be the duty or the Commissioner of the General hand Office to unite a suitable number of these mineral locations into mining<pb n="928" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="198" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>districts, in each of which shall be a surveyor, who must either be the surveyor of the district or county or a regular appointed deputy and an officer qualified to administer oaths.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. A mining claim upon veins or lodes of quartz or other rocks in place bearing silver, gold, cinnabar, lead, tin, copper, and other valu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />able metals, excluding deposits of kaolin, baryta, salt, marble, fire clay, iron ore, coal, oil, natural gas, gypsum, nitrates, mineral paints, asbestos, marls, natural cement, clay, onyx, mica, precious stones or any other non-metallic mineral, and stone valuable for ornamental or building pur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />poses or other valuable building material, may equal but shall not exceed one thousand five hundred feet along the mine or vein or lode. Ho such claim shall exceed twenty-one acres in total area. The end lines of each claim shall be parallel to each other, and all claims shall be in the form of a parallelogram or square, unless such form is prevented by adjoining rights or boundaries of the section in which the claim lies. The locator under this act shall be entitled to the use of all the superficial area be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tween the enclosing lines of the claim, and to all minerals thereon and between the side and end lines, extending downwards vertically, until the rights secured by posting are forfeited as provided; and in all conflicts priority of location shall decide.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. The locators of any mining claim shall post up at the center, of one of the end lines of the same a written notice, stating the name of the location and of the claim and date of posting, and describe the claim by giving the number of feet in length and width and the direction the claim lies in length from the notice, together with the section, if known, and the county, and shall place stone monuments at the four corners and otherwise describe the corners so that they can be readily found. The notice shall be placed in a conspicuous place so it can be readily seen.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. The locator shall, within three months after the date of post<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing the required notice, sink a shaft at least ten feet in depth by four feet square, or a tunnel of the same dimensions ten feet in length, or an open cross cut twenty feet in length, four feet or more wide and ten feet in depth at its shallowest part, and shall within said time file with the county surveyor or the district surveyor of the county, as the case may be, an application in writing for the survey of the claim, which application shall be accompanied by a fee of twenty dollars, unless its tender is waived, and also with an affidavit attached thereto that the required work, signifying that it has been done, and that the locators have found valuable minerals on the claim; and the affidavit shall state the date of the first posting of the notice on the claim by the applicants, and further, that the notice has not been post dated or changed in its date. Upon re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceiving said application and fee the surveyor shall record the application, together with the affidavit, and he shall thereupon forthwith proceed to survey said claim, and forward the field notes to the Commissioner of the General Land Office within thirty days after filing the application, in de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fault of which he shall pay the aggrieved party such damages as he may sustain, and in addition thereto shall be deemed guilty of a misde<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />meanor, and on conviction fined not less than twenty dollars nor more than one hundred dollars, and it shall be the duty of the applicants to see that the field notes are so returned. The fee of twenty dollars shall cover all the services provided for in this section. In all other cases<pb n="929" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="199" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>enumerated in this act the fee shall be the same allowed county clerks for similar services.</p>
<p>Sec. 7. Annually after the filing of the application for a survey as hereinbefore provided, the claimant shall, until after the application is made for a patent, as hereinafter provided, do one hundred dollars worth of work in developing each claim; but where claims adjoin, the amount of work may be done on one for all belonging to the same party. The value of such shall be estimated at what it could be contracted for at a fair cash price, but the cost of tools and implements and the expense of going to and returning from the mine shall not be included in said esti<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mate. Within one month after the expiration of each year the owner shall make and file with the surveyor his affidavit setting forth specific<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ally what the work consists of in detail, and the value thereof. Upon the failure of any one of several owners to contribute his proportion of the expenditures required in this act within the necessary time, the co<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />owners who have performed the labor or made the improvements or paid the fees or other expenditures required in this act, may at the ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />piration of the year in which the same is to be done, give notice in writ<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing or notice by publication in a newspaper published in the county where the claim is, if any; if none in such county, then in the newspaper published nearest the mine, for at least once a week for ninety days. If after such personal notice in writing or by publication such delin<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quent shall fail or refuse to contribute his proportion of the expendi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ture required by this act, his interest in the claim shall become the prop<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />erty of his co-workers who have made the required expenditures. An affidavit by the co-owners forfeiting the interest of such delinquent shall, when recorded in the office of the proper surveyor, be sufficient evidence of such delinquency.</p>
<p>Sec. 8. That when a tunnel is run for the development of a vein or lode or for the discovery; of mines, the owner of such tunnel shall have the right of possession of all veins or lodes within two thousand feet of the face of such claim on the line thereof, not previously known to exist, discovered in such tunnel to the same extent as if discovered from the surface; and locations on the line of such tunnel of veins or lodes not ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pearing on the surface made by other parties after the commencement of the tunnel and while the same is being prosecuted with reasonable diligence shall be invalid; but failure to prosecute the work in the tun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nel for six months shall be considered as an abandonment of the right of all undiscovered veins on the line of said tunnel.</p>
<p>Sec. 9. Whenever the owners of any mining claim shall desire a pat<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ent, they shall, within five years after the filing of the application for survey, file their application for a patent upon their claim with the Com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioner of the General Land Office, accompanied by the receipt of the State Treasurer showing that twenty-five dollars per acre has been paid by the applicant for patent to the State Treasurer. Whereupon such patent shall issue unless protest is filed as hereinafter provided for in section 11.</p>
<p>Sec. 10. Within twelve months after the filing of the affidavit herein<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />after provided for, any person or association of persons qualified as re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quired by section 1 of this act, shall have the right to purchase and ob<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tain patent by compliance with this act, or any of the lands of the State which are specified or included in section 1 of this act, containing valu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />able deposits of kaolin, baryta, salt, marble, fire clay, iron ore, coal, oil, natural gas, gypsum, nitrates, mineral paints, asbestos, marl, natural<pb n="930" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="200" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>cement, clay, onyx, mica, precious stones or any other non-metallic min<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />eral and stones valuable for ornamental or building purposes or other valuable building material, in legal subdivisions, in quantity not exceed<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing one section: Provided, that where any such parties shall have here<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tofore expended, or shall hereafter expend, live thousand dollars in de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />veloping the aforesaid mineral resources of any of said lands, such party shall have the right to buy one additional section and no more, and to include in the purchase any section or part thereof on which the work may have been done. The land so purchased may be in different sec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions, and all embraced in one or more obligations, not to exceed the quantity stated. The purchaser shall pay not less than fifteen dollars per acre where the land shall be situated ten miles or less of any railroad in operation, and not less than ten dollars per acre where the land is over ten miles from such railroad, one-tenth of the purchase money to be paid in cash to the State Treasurer on or before the expiration of the twelve months aforesaid; and the purchasers shall file the Treasurer&#8217;s receipt with the Commissioner of the General Land Office, together with an obligation to pay the State of Texas the remainder in nine equal annual installments, with interest at four per cent per annum from date, subject to forfeiture as in other cases; and all said lands are re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />served from sale or other disposition than under this act; and where ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />plication is made to buy any of the lands herein named except under this act, the purchaser shall swear that there are none of the minerals named in this act on said lands, so far as he knows or has reason to be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lieve or does believe: Provided further, that any party hereinbefore named, who shall prior to the passage of this act have been the first to work on said lands for the development of said mineral resources, and who has not abandoned said work, and is qualified at passage of this act to buy, shall have a prior preference right of doing so for thirty days after this act goes into effect: Provided, further, this section of this, act shall not authorize the sale of lands containing valuable deposits of gold, silver, lead, cinnabar, copper or other valuable metal: Provided further, that any person desiring to acquire any lands under the pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />visions of this section shall have the right to prospect said land for a period of twelve months before making any payment thereon, upon con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dition that said prospector shall file with the proper surveyor his affi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />davit in writing, setting forth that he has gone upon the land in good faith with the intention of purchasing the same under the provisions of this section, and in said affidavit give a reasonable description of said land. After the filing of said affidavit the said surveyor shall im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mediately forward same to the Commissioner of the General Land Office, who shall take said section off the market until the expiration of said twelve months after the filing of said affidavit with the surveyor.</p>
<p>Sec. 11. Any person desiring to contest the issuance of patent may do so by filing with the Commissioner of the General Land Office a protest setting forth the grounds of objection generally, and that protestant has an interest in the subject matter, which protest shall also state that the same is presented in good faith and not to injure or delay the applicants or any of them, and the same shall be verified by affidavit. Whereupon it shall be the duty of the Commissioner to withhold patent until the controversy is ended: Provided, that if the protestant shall not within thirty days after filing his protest institute suit in the court having jur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="931" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="201" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>isdiction thereof in the county where the claims are located, his protest shall constitute no further barrier to the issuance of patent. A certified copy of the petition or a certificate of the clerk of the court where suit is pending shall be sufficient evidence to the Commissioner of the pend<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ency of the suit, and of the date of filing said suit. When the land in controversy lies partly in two counties suit may be brought in either. More than one claim shall not be embraced in the same patent or appli<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cation. The suits here provided for shall be entitled to precedence of trial on the docket.</p>
<p>Sec. 12. All claims upon which, patent has not been applied for within five years next after the application for survey, or which have not been surveyed and the field notes returned to the General Land Office within the time prescribed therefor as hereinbefore provided, or upon which the assessment work has not been done, an affidavit therefor filed as provided by this act, shall be and are declared forfeited without ju<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dicial action of any kind, and subject to location as originally, but not by any one interested in the claim at the time of forfeiture, and any location for or on behalf of any such party shall be wholly void. When<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ever any such claim shall be relocated, the locators and each of them shall make affidavit that the location is made without any contract or agreement of any kind that any of the parties owning an interest in the location before the relocation has or is to have any interest in the same. In all other cases where affidavit is required by this act it may be made by one or more of the parties cognizant of the facts.</p>
<p>Sec. 13. No claim which has been forfeited for any cause shall be sub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ject to relocation for a period of thirty days next thereafter, and the party owning the same may apply to the Land Commissioner within that time for relief, and if it appear to him from the proof submitted that the forfeiture was not occasioned by the negligence of the owner, but by circumstances which he could not reasonably control, the Commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioner may within that time, in his discretion, grant relief against the forfeiture, and if he be granted such relief he shall at once forward his order to that effect to the surveyor, who shall file the same for record in his office.</p>
<p>Sec. 14. Whenever any application shall be made to buy or obtain title to any of the lands embraced in section 1 of this act, except where the application is made under this act, the applicant shall make oath that there is not, to the best of his knowledge and belief, any of the minerals embraced in this act thereon, and when the commissioner has any doubt in relation to the matter he shall forbear action until he is saitisfied. Any such sale or disposition of said lands shall be understood to be, with the reservation of the minerals thereon, to be subject to loca<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion as herein provided.</p>
<p>Sec. 15. That claims usually called placers, including all forms of metallic deposits, excepting veins of quartz or rock in place, shall be sub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ject to entry and patent under like circumstances and conditions and upon similar proceedings as are provided for vein or lode claims. All placer claims located shall conform as near as practicable with existing surveys and their subdivisions, and no such location shall include more than forty acres for each individual claimant, and shall not exceed three hundred and twenty acres for any association of persons. The price which shall be paid for such placer shall not be less than ten dollars per acre, together with all costs of proceedings as before provided.</p>
<pb n="932" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="202" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>
<p>Sec. 16. Where non-mineral land not contiguous to the vein or lode is issued by the prospector of such vein or lode for mining or milling purposes, such non-adjacent surface ground may be embraced and in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cluded in an application for a patent for such vein or lode, and the same may be patented therewith, subject to the same preliminary require<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments as to survey and notice as are applicable to veins or lodes; but no location of such non-adjacent lands shall exceed ten acres, and payment for the same must be made at the same rate as fixed by this act for the superficies of the lode. The owner of a quartz mill or reduction works, not owning a mine in connection therewith, may also receive a patent for a mill site, as provided in this section.</p>
<p>Sec. 17. Any owner or worker of mining claim under this act is authorized to fell and remove for building and mining purposes any tim<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ber or any tree growing or being upon unoccupied lands as described in section 1, said lands being mineral and subject to entry only as mineral lands, under such rules and regulations as may be prescribed for the protection of timber and undergrowth upon such lands, and for other purposes.</p>
<p>Sec. 18. Nothing in this act shall ever be so construed as to either destroy, invalidate or impair any valid claim, right or interest existing in, to or concerning any lands whatever at the passage of this act, of any pre-emptor, purchaser, claimant, actual settler, locator or other per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />son whatsoever.</p>
<p>Sec. 19. The net proceeds of all sales of mining lands under the pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />visions of this act shall inure to the benefit of the State and the re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />spective funds for which the lands mentioned in section 1 of this act are now set apart under the Constitution and laws of the State, and it shall be the duty of the Comptroller, State Treasurer and Commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioner of the General Land Office to see to it and have said proceeds so paid rightly placed to the credit of the particular and proper fund.</p>
<p>Sec. 20. For the purpose of effectually carrying out the provisions of this act all county or district surveyors are hereby especially authorized and empowered to administer oaths, take affidavits and make certificates thereof: Provided, further, that all laws and parts of laws in conflict with this act, or any part thereof, are hereby especially repealed.</p>
<p>Sec. 21. The mining interests of the State are great and important, and there are no general laws free from doubt and uncertainty regulat<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing in an adequate, general and just manner the mining interest of the whole State; therefore, an imperative public necessity and emergency exists for the pasage of this act; therefore, it is enacted that the con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />stitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days be sus<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pended, and that this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>

<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That the members of the commissioners courts of Fannin, Kaufman and Robertson counties shall be ex officio road commissioners of their re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />spective districts, and under the direction of the commissioners courts shall have charge of all the teams, tools and machinery belonging to the county, and placed in their hands by said counties, and it shall be their duty, under such rules and regulations as the commissioners courts may prescribe, to superintend the laying out of new roads, the making or changing of roads, and the building of bridges.

The commissioners court of said counties shall have full power and authority, and it shall be its duty, to adopt such system for working, laying out, draining and repairing the public roads in said counties as it may deem best, and from time to time said court may change its plan or system of working. Said commissioners court shall have power to purchase such teams, tools and machinery as may be necessary for the working of its roads.

The commissioners court may grant a reasonable commutation of time for which a convict is committed as a reward for faithful services and good behavior, in no case to exceed one-tenth of the whole time. Said court may provide the necessary houses, prisons, clothing, bedding, food, med<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />icine, medical attention, and guards for the safe and humane keeping of convicts.

Each road overseer, or in case of his absence any person deputized by him, shall have full control of all road hands within his road district, and shall see that each hand when called out shall perform a good day&#8217;s work; and if any hand when so called out shall fail or refuse to perform a good day&#8217;s work or to work in the manner the overseer may direct, he shall be liable to the same penalty as if he had failed to appear in obedience to the summons.

<p>Sec. 11. At the regular term of the commissioners court in November of each year all road overseers shall make their reports under oath, upon forms to be furnished them by said court, which said report shall be ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />amined by said court, and all accounts for services or labor performed for overwork by such overseer during the past year, and of moneys had and expended by him, shall be audited and settled; and as soon there<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />after as practicable said commissioners court shall appoint and commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sio road overseers for the succeeding year. Any overseer intentionally failing to perform his duties as such overseer, or failing or refusing to make his report as required by law, or failing or refusing to serve and perform the duties of overseer when appointed by said court, or to per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />form any other duty required of him by law or by the commissioners court or by the commissioner of his district, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction shall be fined in any sum not exceed<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing twenty-five dollars.</p>

<p>Sec. 13. Every owner of a farm or other lands upon which a hedge of any description grows on or near the public road shall be required to keep the same trimmed so that the same shall not obstruct said road; and any such owner who shall fail or neglect to so trim such hedge shall be notified in writing by the road overseer of that district to trim such hedge as herein required; and in such case if such owner shall, after re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceiving such notice, fail or refuse to trim such hedge within a reasonable time, he shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction shall be fined in any sum not exceeding twenty dollars per week from and after the time that he receives such notice, such fine to be paid into the county treasury and to be placed to the credit of the road and bridge fund of said county. If any owner of any farm shall fail or refuse, after being notified as herein required, to trim his hedge as required by this<pb n="937" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="207" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>act, then the road overseer shall cause the same to be trimmed in accord<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ance with the provisions of this act, to be paid for out of the road and bridge fund of the county.</p>
<p>Sec. 14. Each county commissioner when acting as road commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioner and performing the duties imposed upon him by law, or by the commissioners court, shall be entitled to two dollars per day for the ser<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vices actually performed: Provided, said sum to be paid him shall not exceed ninety dollars per quarter, which amount shall be paid out of the road and bridge fund when the account shall have been approved by the commissioners court; and the court shall not approve said account un<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />less the commissioner presenting it shall sign an oath that the account is just, due and unpaid, and specifying the number of days actually per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />formed by him, and that it was necessary to be done; and no commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioner shall be entitled to pay as road commissioner either for himself or for his deputy while he is performing the duties of county commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioner, nor shall be receive any additional pay than that provided by this section for inspecting or riding over his road or for other road ser<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vice.</p>
<p>Sec. 15. This act shall be taken notice of by all courts in the same manner as the general law of the State, and it shall be construed to be cumulative of all general laws of the State on the subject of roads and bridges when not in conflict therewith; but in case of conflict, this act shall control as to the counties of Fannin, Kaufman and Robertson.</p>
<p>Sec. 16. The fact that there is now no sufficient general road law in force in this State, creates an emergency and an imperative public neces<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sity that the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three sev<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />eral days be suspended, and that this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>

Said reports shall be sworn to before some officer authorized to administer oaths. Said reports shall be examined by the commissioners court, and if they be found correct shall be approved by said court, and as soon thereafter as practicable the said court shall appoint and commission road overseers for the succeeding year.

<p>Sec. 10. Whenever it shall be necessary to occupy any land for the opening, widening, straightening or draining any road or part thereof, if the owner of said land cannot agree with the courts as to damages to be paid, the court may proceed to condemn the same in the same manner that a railroad company can condemn land for right of way, and the same proceedings may be had and the same right shall exist to each party that would exist if the proceedings were by a railroad company, except that the county shall in no case be required to give bond.</p>
<p>Sec. 11. Each county commissioner when acting as road commissioner shall be entitled to two dollars per day for services actually performed: Provided, that he shall not receive more than one hundred and fifty dol<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lars for any one year; said amount to be paid out of the road and bridge fund, when the account shall have been approved by the commissioners court, and the court shall not approve said account unless the commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioner presenting it shall sign an oath that the account is just, due and unpaid; and said account shall specify the number of days&#8217; work actually performed by him; and no commissioner shall be entitled to pay as road commissioner for the days that he is performing the duties of county commissioner; nor shall be be allowed pay for any other road service, except as herein provided for.

<p>Sec. 13. The fact that there is now no sufficient general road law in force in this State creates an emergency and imperative public necessity that the constitutional rule requiring hills to be read on three several days be suspended, and that this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>

Whenever it shall be necessary to occupy any land for the opening, widening, straightening or draining any road or part thereof, if the owner of said land can not agree with the court as to damages to be paid, the court may proceed to condemn the same in the same man<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ner that a railroad company can condemn land for right of way, and the same proceedings may be had, and the same rights shall exist to each party that would exist if the proceedings were by a railroad company, except that the county shall in no case be required to give bond.</p>
<p>Sec. 12. Each county commissioner when acting as road commissioner shall be entitled to two dollars and one-half per day for services actually performed: Provided, that he shall not receive more than seventy-five dollars per quarter; said per diem to be paid out of the road and bridge fund when the account shall have been approved by the commissioners<pb n="946" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="216" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>court; and the court shall not approve said account unless the commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioner presenting it shall sign an oath that the account is just, due and unpaid; and said account shall specify the number of days&#8217; work act<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ually performed by him, and no commissioner shall be entitled to pay as road commissioner while he is performing the duties of county com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioner.</p>

That in district number one, that portion of the district ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />terior to the city limits be allowed the pro rata of the road funds which it has contributed by taxation. That the balance of the road funds contributed by taxation within the city limits be appropriated as fol<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lows: For the construction and repair of necessary bridges on perma<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nent improvement for first class roads as hereafter provided for in the permanent construction and repair of main thoroughfare roads lead<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing from the city limits to the county lines, the commissioners court to be governed in the selection of routes by the volume of population to be accommodated, donations of labor, money, material, etc., offered by the citizens and property owners of said roadway. That the county con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />victs shall be kept at work all the time upon four first class roads, be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ginning at the city limits, and extending as nearly as practicable north, south, east and west to the county lines, except in cases of emergency, when by an order of the commissioners court said convicts may be temporarily transferred to some other route or the county farm; Pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided, further, that when said four roads have been put in first class condition, four other roads shall be selected by said court leading from the city limits to the county lines; each road to run as nearly as prac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ticable centrally between two of the first four roads herein mentioned. That the roads to be built by the convict labor shall be macadamized, except in the black waxy neighborhoods, where material can not be had with reasonable convenience or reasonable expense, but at such points the roads must be permanently graded and thoroughly drained. That the assessor of taxes be required to prepare a tax roll for each commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioner&#8217;s district separately, except district number one, for which he shall prepare two, one embracing all the property in the city, and the other embracing all the property in district number one outside of the city limits.</p>
<p>Sec. 14. In all cases where the cost of material and labor exceeds two hundred dollars it shall be the duty of said court to construct, grade or otherwise improve any road or bridge by contract, the same to be ad<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vertised for as provided for by said commissioners court.</p>
<p>Sec. 15. This act shall be taken notice of by all courts in the same manner as the general laws of the State on the subject of roads and bridges, when not in conflict therewith; but in case of conflict this act shall control as to Dallas, Lamar and Medina counties.</p>
<p>Sec. 16. The fact that there is now no sufficient general road law in force in this State creates an emergency and imperative public neces<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sity that the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three sev<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />eral days be suspended, and that this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>

<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That chapter 6, article 2519, of the Civil Statutes of the State of Texas, be so amended as to read as follows:</p>
