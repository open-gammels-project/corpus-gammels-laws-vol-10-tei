<p>Sec. 3. Whenever in any suit pending in this State any minor re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />covers a personal judgment for money or other personal property in which the interest of the minor does not exceed the value of five hundred dollars, and said minor has no guardian, such next friend or any person authorized by the court to do so, by an order entered of record, may take charge of said money or property for the benefit of said minor upon giving bond in such sum as shall be ordered by the court, which shall not be less than double the value of the property, conditioned that he will pay over said money and lawful interest thereon and deliver said property and its increase to the minor when he becomes of age, or to his legally qualified guardian when demanded, and that he will pay or deliver the same to such person appointed by the court, when ordered by the court to do so, and that he will use such money or property for the benefit of the minor as ordered by the court.</p>

<p>4. By substituting wagons and teams suitable and satisfactory to the road overseer, as provided in section 8 of this act.</p>
<p>Sec. 11. Every insolvent poll tax payer, being a resident of the county, who shall be indebted to the county on any unpaid county poll tax, and from whom the said poll tax can not be otherwise collected by law, shall be permitted to discharge the amount of such unpaid county poll tax in labor upon the public roads of his precinct, at the rate of one dollar per day; and in order to enforce the provisions of this section, the collector of taxes for the county shall be required, on or before the second Monday in February of every year, to furnish to the several over<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />seers of the county the names of all defaulting poll tax payers, together with the amount of county poll tax due and unpaid by each: for which ex officio service the collector shall be exempt from road duty. And it shall be the duty of the overseer whenever any such person shall have dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />charged his county poll tax as herein provided, to report the same to the tax collector, who shall credit the party on the tax roll and report the same in his regular reports to the commissioners court: Provided, that no fines or penalties shall be recovered of insolvent poll tax payers for failure to work out their poll tax under the provisions of this act.</p>
<p>Sec. 12. Each road overseer shall make his report, under oath, to the commissioners court every six months, giving an itemized statement of all money belonging to the road fund which he has received, from whom received, and for what, and what disposition he has made of the same; the condition of all roads, bridges, culverts, and drains; the num<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />bers and character of all mile posts and guide boards erected, and where the same are located; and such other information as the commissioners court may require; and may accompany said report with such sugges<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions as may seem to him pertinent in regard to the public roads and the duties of his office.</p>
<p>Sec. 13. Any road overseer who shall willfully or negligently fail or refuse to comply with any provision of this act, or to perform any lawful and reasonable order of the commissioners court, or to discharge any duty imposed upon him by this act, or by any other existing law of the State, not in conflict herewith, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof, in a court of competent jurisdiction, shall be punished by fine of not less than ten nor more than one hundred dol<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lars, such fine, when collected, to go into the road and bridge fund.</p>
<p>Sec. 14. Whenever it shall be necessary to occupy any private lands for the purpose of opening, widening, straightening, or draining any pub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lic road or part thereof, if the owner of such land and the commissioners court can not agree upon the amount of damage to be paid, the county may proceed to condemn the same in the same manner that a railroad company can condemn land for right of way, and the same proceedings may be had, and the same Tights shall exist to each party, as would exist if the proceedings were by a railroad company, except that the county shall in no case be required to give bond either for cost or on appeal.</p>
<p>Sec. 15. This act shall be cumulative of all general laws of the State on the subject of roads and bridges, and employment of county convicts, not in conflict herewith, and where not otherwise provided herein such general laws shall apply, but in case of conflict with general laws this act<pb n="447" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="17" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>shall govern; and the courts of the State shall have and take judicial cognizance of this act in the same manner and to the same extent as they are required to know and notice the general laws of the State.</p>
<p>Sec. 16. The vast amount of important business pending, and the fact that the roads of said county are in a deplorable condition for the want of a more efficient road law, creates an emergency, and an imperative public necessity exists that the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days be suspended, and that this act take effect from and after its passage, and it is, so enacted.</p>

An entry thus made,<pb n="480" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="50" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>or a copy thereof, certified under the hand and seal of the clerk of the county court, shall be held sufficient prima facie evidence of such fact of publication.</p>
<p>Article 3235. If a majority voting at such election vote against pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />hibition, the court shall make an order declaring the result, and have the same entered of record in the office of the clerk of said court.</p>
<p>Article 3236. No election under the preceding articles shall be held within the same prescribed limits in less than two years after an election under this title has been held therein, but at the expiration of that time the commissioners court of each county in the State, whenever they decree it expedient, may order another election to be held by the quali<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fied voters of said county, or of any justice&#8217;s precinct, or such subdivision of a county as may be designated by the commissioners court of such county, for the same purpose: Provided, it shall be the duty of such court to order the election aforesaid, whenever petitioned to do so by as many as two hundred voters of any county, or fifty voters of any justice&#8217;s precinct or subdivision of such county, as the case may be, to order an election for the same purpose, which election shall be ordered held, notice thereof given, the votes returned and counted, and the re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sults disclosed and published, in all respects as provided by this title for a first election; and the order granting such other elections, as well as that disclosing the result, shall, if prohibition be carried, have the same force and effect and the same conclusiveness as are given to them in the case of a first election by the provisions of this title.</p>

<p>Article 3238. The failure to carry prohibition in a county shall not prevent an election for the same from being immediately thereafter held in a justice&#8217;s precinct, or subdivision of such county as designated by the commissioners court, or of any town or city in such county, nor shall the failure to carry prohibition in a town or city prevent an election from being immediately thereafter held for the entire justice&#8217;s precinct or county in which said town or city is situated, nor shall the holding of an election in a justice&#8217;s precinct in any way prevent the holding of an election immediately thereafter for the entire county in which the jus<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tice&#8217;s precinct is situated; but when prohibition has been carried at an election ordered for the entire county, no election on the question of prohibition shall be thereafter ordered in any justice&#8217;s precinct, town, or city of said county, until after prohibition has been defeated at a subse<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quent election for the same purpose ordered, and for the entire county, in accordance with the provisions of this title, nor in any case where prohibition has carried in any justice&#8217;s precinct, shall an election on the question of prohibition be ordered thereafter in any town or city of such precinct, until after prohibition has been defeated at a subsequent elec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion ordered and held for such entire precinct.</p>
<p>Article 3239. When any such election has been held and has resulted in favor of prohibition, and the aforesaid court has made the order de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />claring the result, and the order of prohibition, and has caused the same to be published as aforesaid, any person who shall thereafter, within the<pb n="481" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="51" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>prescribed bounds of prohibition, sell, exchange, or give away, with the purpose of evading the provisions of this title, any intoxicating liquors whatsoever, or in any way violate any of the provisions of this title, shall be subject to prosecution by information or indictment, and shall be punished as prescribed in the Penal Code.</p>
<p>Article 3239a. At any time within thirty days after the result of an election has been declared, any qualified voter of the county, justice&#8217;s precinct, or subdivision of such county, or in any town or city of such county, in which such election has been held, may contest the said elec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion in any court of competent jurisdiction in such manner as has been or may hereafter [be] prescribed, and should it appear from the evidence that the election was illegally or fraudulently conducted, or that by the action, or the want of action, on the part of the officers to whom was en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />trusted the control of such election, such a number of legal voters were denied the privilege of voting as, had they been allowed to vote, might have materially changed the result, or if it appears from the evidence that such irregularities existed as to render the true result of the elec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion impossible to be arrived at, or very doubtful of ascertaining, the court shall adjudge said election to be void, and shall order the proper officer to order another election to be held, and shall cause a certified copy of such judgment and order of the court to be delivered to such officer, upon whom it devolved by law the duty of ordering such election.</p>
<p>Article 3239b. In all cases where any person, firm, or association of persons, pursuing the occupation of liquor dealers, under license issued in accordance with the laws of this State, has been or shall hereafter be prevented from pursuing such occupation for the full time to which he would be otherwise entitled, by reason of the adoption of local option in any county, precinct, subdivision of such county, town, or city, a pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />portionate amount of taxes paid by him for the unexpired time shall be refunded to him.</p>
<p>Article 3239c. It is hereby made the duty of the district judges to give this act in charge to the grand juries, and it is made the special duty of the county attorneys to file, or have filed, a complaint in the county court of said county against all houses and the keepers thereof, used for sale, exchange, or gift of any kind of intoxicating liquors in any county, justice&#8217;s precinct, or subdivision of such county, or of any town or city in such county in this State when local option has been voted by the citi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />zens thereof.

<p>Sec. 7. Each railroad company now existing, or that shall hereafter be organized or that shall be reorganized under the laws of this State, or which shall increase its stock under the laws of this State, shall issue cer<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tificates to the subscribers to its said stock under the following regula<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions: A majority of the board of directors shall meet in person in the State of Texas, at the principal office of such company, and shall cause to be made a list of the subscribers to such stock, showing the number of shares subscribed by each, the amount of stock represented by each share and the amount actually paid, labor done or property received on each share of stock, and shall cause to be affixed to each name on said list a number, beginning with number one, or the next highest number of any certificate previously issued.</p>
<p>The president of the board or presiding officer of the meeting at which the issuing of such certificates of stock is authorized, shall make a certifi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cate to said statement to the effect that the same is correct, and that the amount of money paid, labor done and property received as stated is cor<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />rect, and shall sign the same in person. Such statement shall thereupon be entered at large upon the minutes, and after having the seal of the company affixed thereto, shall be attested by the secretary of the com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pany and deposited with the Railroad Commission, and by it filed and preserved in the office. The secretary of the company shall then be au<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />thorized to make out and deliver to each stockholder in said list a cer<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tificate corresponding with said statement in number, name, number of shares, amount of stock represented by each share, and the amount of money or its equivalent paid upon each share, which certificate shall be signed by the president of the said railroad company, attested by the sec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />retary, with the seal of said company affixed. No railroad company shall hereafter increase its stock unless all existing shares of stock shall have been paid in full, or all unpaid shares of such stock have been sold out as forfeited under the law. When the certificates to be issued are for increase of stock, the statement herein required to be made by the board of dirctors shall state that all existing shares of stock have been paid in full or that all shares not paid in full have been sold out or forfeited under the law. In no event shall the stock exceed the value of the rail<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />way property, and the correct aggregate amount of stock so issued by each railway company shall be certified to and registered in the office of the Secretary of State by or at the instance of the Railroad Commission.</p>
<p>Sec. 8. Whenever any railroad company in this State shall hereafter desire to make, issue, and sell any bonds or evidences of debt which are to become a lien on its property, it shall comply with the laws of this State regulating the same, and in addition thereto shall have said bonds prepared, signed by the president of the company, and attested by the secretary, with the seal of the company attached thereto. Bach bond shall be numbered, beginning with number one, or the next highest num<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ber of any preceding bond issued by it, and continue consecutively until<pb n="489" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="59" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>all are numbered. The bonds shall be dated, made payable at a time not exceeding thirty years from date, and shall bear interest not exceeding six per cent per annum. The said bonds, when thus prepared shall be presented to the Railroad Commission of this State, with a statement in writing, signed and sworn to by the president of said company, showing the amount of the stock of said company, and the amount of outstanding bonds, if any, of said company. If said bonds are such as are permitted under this law, and the Railroad Commission shall be so satisfied, it shall approve said bonds, and shall issue to the Secretary of State a direction to register said bonds, specifying the numbers, dates, and amounts thereof. And said Commission shall keep in its office a correct record of the bonds so approved by it, giving the name of the company, the numbers, dates of execution and maturity of the bonds, the amount and rate of interest of each, and the date of approval: Provided, that this provision shall not apply to receivers&#8217; certificates where the amount does not exceed $100,000 dollars.</p>
<p>Sec. 9. When any such bonds shall be presented to the Secretary of State with the direction aforesaid to register, he shall register said bonds by entering a description thereof in a book to be kept for that purpose, which shall show the date, number, amount, when due, the rate of inter<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />est on each bond, and also the date when the same is registered. The Secretary of State shall endorse on each bond, under the seal of his office and his official signature, together with the date thereof, as follows: &#8220;This bond is registered under the direction of the Railroad Commission of Texas.&#8221; No bond or other evidence of debt hereafter issued by or under the authority of any person, firm, corporation, court, or railroad company, whereby a lien is created on its franchises or property situated in this State, shall be valid or have any force until the same has been registered as required herein.</p>
<p>Sec. 10. If any railroad company owning or operating a railroad in this State shall hereafter issue or consent to or cause to be issued any bonds or other evidences of debt to be or become a lien on its railroad property so owned or operated, or shall issue any stock not in accordance with the provisions of this act, such action shall work a forfeiture of the charter of said company, and it shall be the duty of the Attorney General to institute proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction to forfeit the same.</p>
<p>Sec. 11. Every certificate of stock in any railroad company, and every bond and other evidence of debt operating as a lien upon the property of such railroad company, which shall be made, issued or sold without a compliance with this act, shall be void.</p>
<p>Sec. 12. Each and every railroad director, president, secretary or other official who shall knowingly make any false statement upon which to se<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cure the registration of any bond or other evidence of debt as aforesaid, or who shall by false statement knowingly made procure of the Railroad Commission direction to the Secretary of State to register the same, and which shall be by the Secretary of State registered, or shall with knowl<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />edge of such fraud negotiate or cause to be negotiated any such bond or other security issued in violation of this act, shall be guilty of a felony, and upon conviction thereof in any court of competent jurisdiction shall be punished by confinement at hard labor in the State penitentiary for a term of years not less than two nor more than fifteen, and shall likewise<pb n="490" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="60" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>be liable to any creditor of such company for the full amount of damages sustained by such wrongful conduct. Venue in such cases shall be in either of the district courts held in Travis county, or in the county where the principal office of the railway company whose property is sought to be so incumbered or affected is located.</p>
<p>Sec. 13. That nothing in this law, and no act done or performed under or in connection with it, shall be held or construed to bind or make the State of Texas liable to pay or guarantee, in any manner what<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />soever, any obligation, debt, or claim executed or assumed under or by virtue of its provisions.</p>
<p>Sec. 14. Whereas, the Constitution declares that no corporation shall issue stock or bonds except for money paid, labor done, or property actually received, and that all fictitious increase of stock or indebtedness shall be void; and,</p>
<p>Whereas, the laws and now inadequate to protect the public against a violation of this provision of the Constitution; and,</p>
<p>Whereas, securities issued in violation thereof alike defraud the tax<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />payers and investors, and unless immediately cheeked will do irreparable damage to the name of the State of Texas and her commercial interests; therefore an imperative public necessity and emergency exists and re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quire that the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three sev<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />eral days be suspended, and that this bill be placed upon its final passage without being so read, and that this act take effect and be in force from its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>

The vast amount of important business pending, and the fact that the roads of said counties are in a deplorable condition for the want of a more efficient road law, creates an emergency and an imperative public necessity requiring that the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days be suspended, and it is so enacted, and that this act take effect from and after its passage.</p>

<p>Sec. 17. This act does not repeal any law in force for the protection of domestic animals, but is cumulative thereto.</p>
<p>Sec. 18.

<salute>An act to amend article 1139 of title 28, chanter 1, of the Revised Civil Statutes of the State of Texas, and to add thereto articles 1139a, 1139b, and 1139c.</salute>
</opener>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That article 1139 of title 28, chapter 1, of the Revised Civil Statutes of the State of Texas, be so amended as hereafter to read as follows, and to add thereto articles 1139a, 1139b, and 1139c:</p>
<p>Article 1139. When a judge of the county court is disqualified by any of the causes above stated, the parties may, by consent, appoint a proper person to try such case.</p>
<p>Article 1139a. Whenever a judge of the county court is disqualified to try a civil case pending in the county court, and the parties shall fail at the first term of the court to agree upon a special judge, it shall be the duty of the judge to certify to the Governor that he is disqualified to try such case, and the failure of the parties to agree upon a proper person to try the same, whereupon the Governor shall proceed to ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />point some person, learned in the law, to try such case. But when a county judge is disqualified to act in probate matters in any cause, he shall forthwith certify his disqualification in such case to the Governor, whereupon the Governor shall appoint some person to act as special judge in said case, who shall act from term to term until such disquali<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fication ceases to exist.</p>
<p>Article 1139b. Whenever any case or cases are called, or pending, in which the county judge, or the special judge chosen, as hereinbefore pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided, shall be a party, or have an interest, or have been attorney, or of counsel, or otherwise disqualified from sitting in and trying the same, no transfer of or removal of shall be made necessary thereby, but the parties or their counsel shall have the right to select and agree upon an attorney of the court for the trial thereof; and if the parties or their attorneys shall fail to select or agree upon an attorney for the trial of such case at or before the time it is called for trial, or if the trial of the case is pending,<pb n="506" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="76" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>and the county judge should become unable to act, or is absent, and a special judge is selected who is disqualified to proceed with the trial, and the parties fail to select or agree upon a special judge who is qualified at once, it shall be the duty of the county judge or special judge presiding to certify the fact to the Governor immediately by telegram, mail, or otherwise, whereupon the Governor shall appoint a special judge, not so disqualified to try the same. The evidence of such appointment by the Governor may be transmitted by telegram, or otherwise. The special judge, after taking the oath of office prescribed by the Constitution, shall proceed to the trial or disposition of such case immediately, if the trial is pending, otherwise when called or reached, as in other cases. That any special judge agreed upon or appointed to try causes shall receive the same pay for his services as is now provided by law for county judges.</p>
<p>Article 1139c. Whenever a special judge is agreed upon by the parties, or is appointed by the Governor, for the trial of any particular cause, as above provided, the clerk shall enter in the minutes of the court as a part of the proceedings in such cause a record showing:</p>
<p>1. That the judge of the court was disqualified to try the cause; and</p>
<p>2. That such special judge [naming him] was by consent agreed upon by the parties to try the cause; or</p>
<p>3. That the parties having failed to agree upon a proper person to try the cause and the judge of the court having certified that fact to the Governor he had appointed such special judge [naming him] to try the cause; and</p>
<p>4. That the oath prescribed by law has been duly administered to such special judge: Provided that all cases heretofore transferred by the county court to the district court on account of the disqualification of the county judge shall be considered lawful and the district courts to which such causes have been transferred shall retain jurisdiction thereof.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. The fact that there is now no provision providing for the selection of special county judges when the county judge is disqualified, creates an imperative public necessity and an emergency requiring the suspension of the constitutional rule requiring hills to be read on three several days, therefore said constitutional rule is hereby suspended, and that this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>

<p>Section 1.

<p>Article 573. When the judge of the county court is disqualified in any criminal case pending in the county court, the parties interested may, by consent, appoint a proper person to try said case, and if the parties shall fail to agree upon a special judge to try such case, on or before the third day of the term of the court at which said case may be called for trial, the county judge shall forwith certify the facts to the Governor, who shall appoint some practicing attorney to try such case.</p>
<p>Article 573a.

The collector of taxes shall then immediately forward his reports so certified to the Comptroller, and shall pay over to the State Treasurer all moneys collected by him for the State during said month, excepting such amounts as he is allowed by law to pay in his county, reserving only his commissions on the total amount collected; and to enable him to do so he may, at his own risk, send the same to the State Treasurer at the least cost to the State, on which he shall be allowed credit by the Comptroller upon filing receipts showing actual amount of exchange paid: Provided, that the State Treasurer shall accept no payment other than money or<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ders or direct cash payments, which may be made through express com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />panies, banks, or any other source. The State Treasurer whenever he may receive a remittance from a collector of taxes shall promptly pay the money so remitted into the State Treasury, on the deposit warrant of the<pb n="521" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="91" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>Comptroller, and the money when so deposited shall be a credit to the said collector of taxes.</p>
<p>4. The collector of taxes shall pay over to the State Treasurer all bal<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ances in his hands belonging to the State, and finally adjust and settle his account with the Comptroller on or before the first day of May of each year; and to enable him to do so, the commissioners court shall con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vene on or before the third Monday in April for the purpose of examin<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing and approving his final settlement papers.</p>
<p>4a. The allowance of a delinquent and insolvent list to the collector, in accordance with article 4744, shall not absolve any taxpayer or prop<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />erty thereon from the payment of taxes, but it shall be the duty of the collector to use all necessary diligence to collect the amounts due thereon, after it is allowed by the commissioners court, and he shall issue special tax receipts therefor, to be furnished by the Comptroller, which blank receipts shall be numbered and charged to the collector, who shall account for same at his next annual settlement, in the same manner as occupation tax receipts; he shall also make itemized monthly reports of such collections, using special blanks for that purpose.</p>
<p>5. To enforce the prompt and speedy collection and remittance of taxes, and to provide for the proper accounting of same, the Comptroller shall prescribe and furnish the forms to be used by collectors of taxes, and the mode and manner of keeping and stating their accounts, and shall adopt such regulations as he may deem necessary in regard thereto. It shall be his imperative duty to enforce a strict observance of all the provisions of these articles.</p>
<p>6. Any collector of taxes failing to promptly comply with the require<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments of these articles, or of article 4744, shall be fined in a sum not less than three hundred nor more than one thousand dollars, and each failure to make the required monthly or annual report or remittance of the amounts shown therein to be due, shall constitute a separate offense.</p>
<p>7. That any collector of taxes in this State who shall issue an occupa<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion tax receipt upon any blank paper, or blank of any kind whatever other than the blank occupation tax receipt furnished to him as required by law, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and each receipt so unlawfully issued shall constitute a separate offense, and upon conviction in any court of competent jurisdiction, shall be punished by fine of not less than one hundred dollars nor more than five hundred dollars.</p>
<p>8. It shall be the duty of the Comptroller to notify the district attor<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ney of the district, or the county attorney of the county in which the collector resides, and the sureties on the bond of the collector, of any such failure to comply with any of the provisions of this article.</p>
<p>Article 4743. 1. The collector of taxes shall at the end of each month make like reports to the commissioners court of all the collec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions made for the county, conforming as far as applicable and in like manner to the requirements as to the collection and report of taxes col<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lected for the State. The county clerk shall likewise, within two days after the presentation of said report by the collector, examine said report and stubs, and certify to their correctness as regards names, dates, and amounts, for which examination and certificate he shall be paid by the collector of taxes fifty cents each month, which amount shall be allowed to the collector by the commissioners court.</p>
<p>2. The clerk shall file said report intended for the commissioners<pb n="522" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="92" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>court, together with the tax receipts stubs, in his office for the next reg<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ular meeting of the commissioners court.</p>
<p>3. The collector of taxes shall immediately pay over to the county treasurer all taxes collected for the county during said month, after re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />serving his commissions for collecting the same, and take receipts there<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />for, and file with the county clerk.</p>
<p>4. At the nest regular meeting of the commissioners court, the col<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lector of taxes shall appear before said court and make a summarized statement, showing the disposition of all moneys, both of the State and county, collected by him during the previous three months. Said state<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment must show that all taxes due the State have been promptly re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mitted to the State treasury at the end of each month, and all taxes due the county have been paid over promptly to the county treasurer and shall file proper vouchers and receipts showing same.</p>
<p>5. The commissioners court shall examine such statement and vouch<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ers, together with the itemized report and tax receipt stubs filed each month, and shall compare the same with the tax rolls and tax receipt stubs. If found correct in every particular, and if the collector of taxes has properly accounted for all taxes collected, as provided above, the commissioners court shall enter an order approving said report, and the order approving same shall be recorded in the minutes, as other pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceedings of said court.</p>
<p>6. The collector of taxes shall finally adjust and settle his account with the commissioners court for the county taxes collected, at the same time and in the same manner as is provided in the foregoing article in his settlement with the State.</p>
<p>1. If any county clerk refuse to make the examinations and certifi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cates, as required in the foregoing articles, he shall be fined not less than fifty nor more than two hundred dollars for each failure to do so.</p>
<p>Article 4743a. 1. It any collector of taxes shall have failed, at the end of each month, or within three days thereof, to promptly remit to the State treasurer the amount due by him to the State, or pay over to the county treasurer the amount due by him to the county, the commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioners&#8217; court, at the next regular meeting, shall ascertain the facts, and if the collector of taxes fails or refuses to pay or remit the same and file proper vouchers therefor, as provided in the foregoing article, the com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioners&#8217; court shall not approve his reports and accounts, but shall ascertain the amounts due by him, both to the State and county, and enter an order requiring him to pay the same to the proper treasurers, as is provided in article 4769a, sections 1 and 2, of the Revised Statutes, and notify such collector, as is provided for in article 4769a, section 3, under penalty for failure to do so, in section 4 of said article.</p>
<p>2. Whenever the collector of taxes shall fail or refuse to remit to the State Treasurer the amounts due the State, when requested, the Comp<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />troller shall notify him under article 4769a, sections 3, 4, 5, and 7.</p>
<p>Article 4744. The collector of taxes shall make out on forms, to be furnished for that purpose by the Comptroller of Public Accounts, be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tween April 1 and 15 of each year, lists of delinquent or insolvent tax<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />payers, the caption of which shall be the &#8220;list of delinquent or insolvent taxpayers.&#8221; In this list he shall give the name of the person, firm, com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pany, or corporation from whom the taxes are due, in separate columns, and he shall post one copy of these delinquent or insolvent lists at the<pb n="523" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="93" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>court house door of the county, and one list at the court house door, or where court is usually held, in each justice precinct in his county; and the collector of taxes, upon the certificate of the commissioners court that the persons appearing on the insolvent or delinquent lists have no property out of which to make the taxes assessed against them, or that they have moved out of the county, and that no property can be found in the county belonging to such persons, out of which to make the taxes due, shall be entitled to a credit on final settlement of his accounts for the amounts due by the persons, firms, companies, or corporations cer<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tified to by the commissioners court, as above provided for.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. Articles 4761, 4762, 4763, 4764, 4765 and 4766 of the Revised Statutes, and all other laws and parts of laws in conflict with this act, are hereby repealed.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. The fact that the time for annual settlements of collectors is near at hand, and the law is inadequate regarding reports and remit<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tances from collectors, creates an emergency and an imperative public necessity requiring the suspension of the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days, and the same is hereby suspended, and that this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>

<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That the commissioners court of Nacogdoches county shall have the power to lay out and condemn land for right of way, and establish and maintain a first class public road, leading from the corporate limits of the town of Nacogdoches, in said county, around a steep hill, known as Orton&#8217;s Hill, in the direction of the town of San Augustine, in San Augustine county, and to intersect the main public road leading from said town of Nacogdoches to the town of San Augustine at a suitable point, after passing around said hill.</p>

Whereas, the near approach of the close of the session of the Legislature, and the great number of bills now pending make it doubtful whether this bill will be reached, and that there is now no adequate law authorizing said court to lay out and condemn land for right of way to establish and maintain said road, therefore an imperative public necessity exists for the suspension of the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days, and said rule is suspended; and that this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>

<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That the county commissioners courts of Cameron, Harris, Fayette, Dal<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />las, Rockwall, Brazos, Coryell, Bexar, and Ellis counties, State of Texas, may, as hereinafter provided, build or construct, or cause to be built or constructed, in said counties, lasting or permanent county roads and bridges of some permanent or durable material, to be selected and agreed upon by said commissioners courts, and may also construct drains or ditches to carry off the waters from such road or roads, and from lands adjacent thereto, whenever and wherever same can be done without con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />flicting with the rights of private property owners, and may take and condemn any land or lands necessary for the purpose of constructing roads or drains under its general powers of eminent domain.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. Whenever the commissioners courts of said counties shall deem it necessary or expedient to build or construct any public roads and bridges of the character herein provided for, they shall pass a reso<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lution, which may be done at any regular or special meeting of said courts, setting forth that it is the sense of said commissioners court that public roads and bridges of a lasting or permanent nature should be con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />structed or built in said county, and that the county should issue its bonds to raise money for that purpose. Said resolution shall be sub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mitted to a vote of the property owners of said counties at any regular or special election, which may be ordered by the commissioners court for that purpose; and if at such election, a majority of the votes cast shall be for said resolution, the same shall be adopted, but if a majority of votes cast at such election shall be against said resolution it shall be re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />jected. Such election shall be governed in all respects by the laws gov<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />erning elections in this State, and the returns shall be made and can<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vassed in the same manner, and result declared by proclamation of the county judge, which proclamation shall be posted in at least three public places in said counties, and at the option of the commissioners court pub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lished in some newspaper in said counties.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. No person shall be permitted to vote at any election as pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided for in section 2 of this article, unless he is a property owner and taxpayer in said counties of Harris, Fayette, Cameron, Dallas, Rockwall,<pb n="525" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="95" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>Brazos, Coryell, Bexar, or Ellis, and unless he is otherwise a qualified voter of said county. Those desiring to vote for the resolution shall have written or printed on their tickets the words, &#8220;For the resolution to issue bonds to build permanent county roads and bridges,&#8221; and those desiring to vote against the resolution shall have written or printed on their tickets the words, &#8220;Against the resolution to issue bonds to build perma<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nent county roads and bridges.&#8221; Such tickets shall be written or printed on plain white paper with black ink, and shall contain no distinguishing mark or device, except the words above set out, and if printed, shall be in type of uniform size and face.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. If, at the election herein provided for, a majority of the qualified voters at such election shall vote in favor of the resolution pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided for in section 2 of the act, and after the commissioners court has canvassed the said vote and declared the result, and after the proclama<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion of the county judge declaring said result has been posted for at least thirty days, it shall be the duty of the county commissioners court, un<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />der the supervision and direction of the Comptroller of this State, to prepare and execute the bonds of the county for such sums as may be deemed advisable by said commissioners courts, said bonds to bear not exceeding five per cent interest, payable annually, and which shall be redeemable in not less than ten years and not more than forty years from the date thereof, the maturity to be expressed on the face of the bonds, and shall have the same registered or enrolled, as in the case of other county bonds, and the same shall not be sold or negotiated at less than their face or par value: Provided, that in no case shall, said county issue bonds under this act for a greater sum or amount than a levy of fifteen cents on the hundred dollars property valuation of such county will yield sufficient revenue to pay the interest as it accrues, and will at the same time create a sinking fund sufficient to pay the principal at maturity.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. When the bonds of the county are issued and sold under the provisions of this act, it shall be the duty of the county commissioners court of said county to levy an annual ad valorem tax on all property of the county, which tax, when collected, shall be used only for the purpose of paying the interest on the county road and bridge bonds, and create a sinking fund to pay the principal of same; and after the adoption of the resolution as herein provided for, it shall be unlawful for the county commissioners court to transfer any funds from the road and bridge fund to any other fund of said county, or to divert, the funds arising from the sale of such bonds, or any funds that may be derived from the road and bridge tax of said county, to any other purpose than the construction and maintenance of county roads and bridges. Should the commission<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ers court of said counties divert any funds contrary to the provisions of this act, they and each member of said court so acting or voting shall be deemed guilty of malfeasance in office, and on conviction shall be pun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ished by a fine of two hundred dollars, and may be removed from office.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. Whenever there shall be or remain in the treasury of this State any moneys to the credit of the permanent school fund, uninvested, the State Board of Education is authorized and empowered to lend the same to said county, when it shall have complied with the foregoing provisions of this act, by purchasing at par value the permanent road and bridge bonds of said county, when satisfactory evidence is presented to said<pb n="526" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="96" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>board that all the provisions of this act have been complied with. And the State Board of Education shall have the preference to purchase said permanent road and bridge bonds, when there is sufficient permanent school funds in the treasury, and they are satisfied that all requirements of law in reference to the issuing of said bonds have been complied with. Should there not be sufficient money in the treasury to the credit of the permanent school funds to purchase the whole issue of such county road and bridge bonds, then the State Board of Education may purchase said bonds to the extent of the funds on hand, or the county commissioners court may, at their option, place said issue of bonds elsewhere, as to them may seem best for the interest of the county; and in like manner, the county permanent school fund may be invested in such county bonds, and whenever said county shall have on hand permanent school funds uninvested, said county shall have the preference to invest said funds in the road and bridge bonds of said county.</p>
<p>Sec. 7. The moneys arising from the sale of the bonds herein pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided for shall not be used for any other purpose than the construction of durable and permanent county roads and bridges, and the purchase of material therefor, and any county commissioners court, or any county commissioner, or any other person, who shall misapply or convert same or any part thereof to any other purpose than the one named, shall be deemed guilty of malfeasance in office, and on conviction shall be pun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ished as hereinbefore provided for that offense.</p>
<p>Sec. 8.

<p>Sec. 9. That all laws and parts of laws in conflict with the provisions of this act be and the same are hereby repealed.</p>

The great importance to the counties of Cameron, Harris, Fayette, Dallas, Rockwall, Coryell, Bexar, and Ellis of the passage of this act, and the near approach of the close of the present session of the Legislature, and the crowded condition of the calendar, create an emer<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gency and an imperative public necessity requiring the suspension of the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days in each house be suspended, and said rule is so suspended; and that this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>

<p>Sec. 7.

<p>Section 1.

<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That whenever, in the opinion of the judge of the twenty-sixth judicial district, there shall be a sufficient number of civil cases pending in the district court of any county in said district, in excess of what can be dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />posed of at the regular terms of said court, to justify the holding of a special term of said court to try pending civil cases, the judge of said, district shall have power to order and hold, from time to time, special terms in said county for the trial of such pending civil cases alone. By pending civil cases is meant all civil cases the service in which was so perfected at the last regular term preceding a special term, that the same might have been lawfully tried at said regular term, as well as other civil cases brought before such special term begins, or while it may be in session, in which an agreement to try the same at such special term may be made by all the parties thereto.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. That, in order to call a special term of the district court in any county in said district, the judge of said district shall, either in term time or vacation, make and file with the clerk of the district court of such county, an order, to be entered in the minutes of said court, order<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing a special term of said court, stating the time when the same shall commence, and during what time said term will be held, and the time during such term when the nonjury civil cases and jury civil cases will he respectively given precedence in the trial of causes at said special term.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. That the clerk of such court, on the receipt of such order, shall immediately enter the same at large upon the minutes of said court, and shall make and place in the hands of the sheriff of said county eight certified copies of said order as the same appears of record in the minutes of said court. Whereupon, the sheriff of said county shall give notice of such order by posting a copy of the same in six public places in said county, one of which shall be at the court house door of such county, for not less than twenty days prior to the time fixed in said order for the commencement of said special term, and shall cause one of said copies to be printed once a week for three weeks in some newspaper in said county prior to the commencement of said special term, if there be a newspaper printed in said county, as often as once a week for three weeks prior to the time fixed by said order for the commencement of said special term, and said sheriff shall endorse on the eighth copy his return, showing how he has complied with this act in giving notice of such order, and file the same with the clerk of. said court by 9 o&#8217;clock a. m. on the day on which said special term is to begin, and said copy and the return thereon shall be entered at large upon the minutes of said court.

<p>Sec. 6. That the fact that there is pending in the district court of Williamson county, in said district, a large number of civil cases which it has been impossible to try at the regular terms of said court, and also try the criminal cases which have been pending in said court, and for the trial of which civil cases a special term is required, and the fact that there is no adequate law authorizing calling special terms of district courts, creates an imperative public necessity which authorizes the suspension of the rule requiring bills to be read on three several days, and said rule is hereby suspended; and the same facts create an emergency requiring that this act take effect from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>

At the time of making any such contract the court shall direct the county treasurer to pass the amount to a particular fund for that purpose, and the treasurer shall keep a separate account of such fund, and the same shall not be used for any other purpose, and can only be paid out on the order of said court; and the said court shall have authority to employ any hands or teams to work on the roads, under such regulations and for such price as they may deem best.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. The commissioners court of said counties shall require all county convicts, not otherwise employed, to labor upon the public roads, under such regulations as it may prescribe, and each convict so worked shall receive a credit of fifty cents on his fine first, and then on the cost, for each day he may labor. The commissioners court may, at a regular term, allow to the officers and witnesses such amount of their, cost for the arrest and conviction of said convict as it may deem best: Provided, that it shall not allow to any officer, an amount greater than the, follow<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing: County judge, $3.00; county attorney, $5.00, including commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sions; county clerks and justices of the peace, $1.70; sheriffs or constables, $2.00; which amount shall be paid to the officers out of the road and bridge fund, on the warrant of the county judge, when said fine and costs shall have been worked out as provided in this section: Provided, that this shall not be construed as to relieve any convict from the pay<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment of all costs for which he would be liable under the general laws of this State. The commissioners court may grant a reasonable com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mutation of time for which a convict is committed, as a reward for faith<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ful services and good behavior: Provided, that such commutation shall in no case exceed one-tenth of the whole time. The commissioners court may provide the necessary houses, prisons, clothing, bedding, food, medicine, medical attention, and guards, for the safe and humane keep<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing of convicts.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. Each county commissioner shall have control of all road over<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />seers in his district, and shall deliver to each of them all teams, tools, and machinery necessary in working the roads in the district of said overseer, so far as he has been supplied therewith by the commissioners court, taking receipt of said road overseer therefor, specifying each item and giving its value, which receipt shall be a full answer of the liability of the commissioner, and shall fix the liability of the overseer; and any commissioner or overseer who shall have been entrusted with any team, tools, or machinery belonging to said county, shall be liable for any dam<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ages that may occur to the same while in his possession. It shall be the duty of the road Overseer, when he has finished work on his road, to return to said commissioner all teams, tools, and machinery received from him, and to take up the receipt given therefor.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. It shall be the duty of the county commissioner, when acting as road commissioner, to inform himself of the condition of the public roads in his district, and shall determine what character of work shall be done upon said roads, and shall direct the manner of grading, draining.<pb n="538" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="108" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>or otherwise improving the same, which directions shall be observed and obeyed by all road overseers of his district.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. The commissioners may require each road overseer in his dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />trict to call out the hands in such numbers as may be sufficient to per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />form the work, but no road hand shall be required to work exceeding five days in any one year, unless the term of service as prescribed by the general laws shall be extended beyond that time: And provided, that all road hands in a particular district shall, as far as practicable, be worked a uniform time. Each road overseer shall have full control of all road hands within his road district, and he shall see that each hand, when called out, shall perform a good day&#8217;s work; and if any hand, when so called out, shall fail or refuse to perform a good day&#8217;s work, or to work in the manner the overseer may direct, he shall be liable to the same penalty as if he had failed to appear in obedience to the summons. The commissioners court may allow to any overseer who shall be engaged in the discharge of the duties of his office for more than five days during any one year, a compensation, not to exceed one dollar and one-half per day, for the time so served.</p>
<p>Sec. 7. Any citizen of Collin, Grayson, Lamar, Williamson, and Bell counties, liable for road duty, who shall, on or before the first day of January of any year, pay to the county treasurer the sum of $3, shall be exempt from road duty for such year, beginning on the first day of Jan<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />uary. The treasurer shall receive and receipt for all money so paid him, and place the same to the credit of the road and bridge fund, and he shall keep a separate account for each road district from which it is re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceived. The treasurer shall, on the third day of January, or as soon thereafter as practicable, furnish to each county commissioner a list of all persons in their respective districts that have paid said sum as pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided in this section.</p>
<p>Sec. 8. Whenever it shall be necessary to occupy any land for the pur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pose of opening, widening, straightening, or draining any road or part thereof, if the owner of such land and the county commissioners court can not agree upon the damage to be paid, the county may proceed to condemn the same in the same manner that a railroad company can con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />demn land for right of way, and the same proceedings may be had, and the same rights shall exist to each party as would exist if the proceedings were by a railroad company, except that the county shall in no case be required to give bond.</p>
<p>Sec. 9. Every owner of a farm or other lands, upon which a hedge of any description grows on or near the public road, shall be required to keep the same trimmed so that the height of the same shall not exceed eight feet above the level of the ground. Any such owner who shall fail or neg<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lect to so trim such hedge, shall be notified in writing by the road over<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />seer of that district to trim such hedge as herein required; and in such case [if] such owner shall, after receiving such notice, fail or refuse to so trim such hedge within a reasonable time, he shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction shall be fined in any sum not to exceed $20 per week from and after the time that he received such notice; such fine to be paid into the county treasury and to be placed to the credit of the road and bridge fund of said county. If any owner of any farm shall fail or refuse, after being notified as herein required, to trim his hedge as required by this act, then the road overseer shall cause the same to be<pb n="539" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="109" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>trimmed in accordance with the provisions of this act, to be paid out of the road and bridge fund of the county.</p>
<p>Sec. 10. Each county commissioner, when acting as road commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioner, and performing the duties imposed upon him by law, or by the commissioners court, shall be entitled to two dollars per day for the ser<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vices actually performed: Provided, that he shall not receive more than forty-five dollars ($45.00) per quarter, when the road and bridge tax has not been levied as provided by law, under the amendment of 1889, as adopted in 1890, to the Constitution of the State of Texas. And when said tax shall have been levied he may receive an amount not to exceed ninety ($90) per quarter, which amount shall be paid out of the road and bridge fund, when the account shall have been approved by the commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioners court, and the court shall not approve said account unless the commissioner presenting it shall sign an oath that the account is just, due, and unpaid, and specifying the number of days work actually per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />formed by him, and that it was necessary to be done: and no commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioner shall be entitled to pay as road commissioner while he is perform<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing the duties of a county commissioner.</p>
<p>Sec. 11. This act shall be taken notice of by all courts in the same manner as the general law of the State, and it shall be construed to be cumulative of all general laws of the State on the subject of roads and bridges when not in conflict therewith; but in a case of conflict this act shall control as to the counties of Collin, Grayson, Williamson, Lamar, and Bell; and an act passed at the regular session of the Twenty-second Legislature, approved April 4, 1891, providing a special road law for Col<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lin County, is hereby repealed.</p>
<p>Sec. 12. The fact that there is now no sufficient general road law in force in this State creates an emergency and imperative public necessity that the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days be suspended, and that this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>
<p>[Note.&#8212;The foregoing act was presented to the Governor of Texas for his approval on the 20th day of April, A.

<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That the county court of Dallas county shall have exclusive original ju<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />risdiction of all misdemeanors of which exclusive original jurisdiction is not given to the justice&#8217;s court,as the same is now or may hereafter be pre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />scribed by law, and when the fine to be imposed shall exceed $200; and it shall have exclusive original jurisdiction in all civil cases when the matter in controversy shall exceed in value $200, and not exceed $500, exclusive of interest; and concurrent jurisdiction with the district court when the matter in controversy shall exceed $500 and not exceed $1000, exclusive of interest; but it shall not have jurisdiction of suits for the recovery of land. It shall have appellate jurisdiction in cases, civil and criminal, of which justices&#8217; courts have original jurisdiction, but of such civil cases only when the judgment of the court appealed from shall exceed $20, exclusive of cost, under such regulations as may be prescribed by law. In all appeals from justices&#8217; courts there shall be a trial de novo in the county court, and appeals may be prosecuted from the final judgments rendered in such cases by the county court, as well as all cases, civil and criminal, of which the county court has exclusive or concurrent or orig<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />inal jurisdiction of civil appeals in civil cases to the Court of Civil Ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />peals, and in such criminal cases to the Court of Criminal Appeals, with such exceptions and under such regulations as may be prescribed by law. The county court shall have the general jurisdiction of a probate court: it shall probate wills; appoint guardians of minors, idiots, lunatics, per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sons non compos mentis, and common drunkards; grant letters testa<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mentary and of administration; settle accounts of executors; transact all business appertaining to deceased persons, minors, idiots, lunatics, per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sons non compos mentis, and common drunkards, including the settle<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment, partition, and distribution of estates of deceased persons; and to apprentice minors as provided by law; and the county court, or judge thereof, shall have power to issue writs of injunction, mandamus, and<pb n="547" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="117" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>all writs necessary to the enforcement of the jurisdiction of said court, and to issue writs of habeas corpus in cases where the offense-charged is within the jurisdiction of the county court or any other court or tribunal inferior to said court.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. At the present session of the Legislature a hill has been passed, creating a criminal district court for the county of Dallas. Sec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion 16, article 5, of the Constitution, provides that the county court shall not have criminal jurisdiction in any county where there is a criminal district court, unless expressly conferred by law. It is the desire of the Legislature that the jurisdiction of the county court of Dallas county, as it now exists, or as it existed before the passage of said law, should not be changed. By reason of the facts recited, and by reason of the cir<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cumstance that the Legislature will soon adjourn, an imperative public necessity exists that the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days be suspended, and that this act should take effect at the same time the bill heretofore referred to, creating a criminal district court for Dallas county, shall take effect; said rule is therefore suspended; and this act shall take effect at the time said law becomes operative, and it is so enacted.</p>

<opener>
<salute>An act to amend article 576, title 20, chapter 3, of the Revised Civil Statutes of the State of Texas, and to validate certain increase of capital stock of private corporations heretofore issued.</salute>
</opener>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That article 576, title 20, chapter 3, of the Revised Civil Statutes of the State of Texas, be amended so as to hereafter read as follows:</p>
<p>Article 576. Any corporation may increase its capital stock to any amount, not exceeding at any one time double the amount of its author<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ized capital, by a vote of the stockholders, in conformity with the by<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />laws thereof, and if a majority of the stockholders shall vote for the in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />crease of the stock, the same may be increased by the board of directors, trustees, or other business managers of such corporation, and upon such increase of stock being made, in accordance with the by-laws, the date and amount shall be certified to the Secretary of State by the directors or trustees, and from the time such certificate is filed, the increase of stock shall become a part of the capital thereof. Such certificate shall be filed and recorded in the same manner as the charter: Provided, that no stock shall be issued except for money paid, labor done, or prop<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />erty actually receiyed.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. That in all cases where the amount of the capital stock of any corporation has heretofore been increased by more than one increase thereof to an amount in excess of double the amount of the original cap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ital, and such increase has been made with the sanction of the Secretary of State, under his construction of the law, such increase shall be, and the same is hereby, validated and declared legal.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. The fact that the Secretary of State has construed the existing law in conformity with this bill, and the fact that a reasonable doubt exists as to the correctness of such construction, and the further fact that many corporations, under such ruling, have by successive increase more than doubled the amount of their original capital stock, creates an emer<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gency, and a public necessity exists that the constitutional rule requiring<pb n="554" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="124" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>bills to be read on three several days be and the same is hereby sus<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pended, and that this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>
<p>[Note.&#8212;The foregoing act was presented to the Governor of Texas for his approval on the 26th day of April, A.

<salute>An act to provide for the payment by new coun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ties of their proportionate share of the indebtedness of the older counties from which they were created.</salute>
</opener>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That any county which has heretofore been created, or may hereafter be created, by the Legislature of the State of Texas, out of any other county or counties, shall be held liable for and bound to pay its proportion of all the liabilities of the county or counties from which it was taken, existing at the date of its creation of such new county, according to the propor<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tionate value of the property in the excised territory, and the value of the property remaining in the old county, and a suit to recover the same may be brought by the parent county either in the district court of such parent county or in the district court of the newly created county and the court shall have power to make any order or render any judgment necessary to carry out and satisfy its decree therein: Provided, that the provisions of this act shall not apply to any county the claims against which have already been placed before courts having jurisdiction thereof and tried or dismissed under laws that were at such time constitutional.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. Where any suit has been or shall be brought to enforce pay<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment of the indebtedness created by the parent county or counties, or for the pro rata share of the excised territory, the assessment rolls of the parent county or counties for the year in which such new county was created shall be conclusive evidence of the property and value thereof remaining in the parent county and in the excised territory at the date of the creation of such new county: Provided, that when the new county was organized and made assessment rolls for the same year as that in which it was created, such rolls shall be taken as conclusive evi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dence of the property therein and the taxable values thereof at the date of the creation of such new county, and the assessment rolls of the par<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ent county for the same year shall be conclusive evidence of the prop<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />erty and the value thereof remaining in the parent county at the date of the creation of such new county.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. All suits brought under this act are hereby declared to be of general public interest, and shall be given precedence upon the dockets of the courts of this State; and if the plaintiff shall recover, it shall be the duty of the commissioners court of the newly created county to levy a<pb n="555" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="125" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>special tax on all property in the territory taken from the plaintiff county sufficient to pay off the judgment, and if the first levy he insufficient, to make said levy annually till said judgment is satisfied, and the judg<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment of the court shall order said commissioners court to make such levies.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. Whereas the Constitution of the State of Texas provides that when any part of a county is stricken off and attached to or created into another county, the part stricken off shall be holden for, and obliged to pay its proportion of all the liabilities, then existing, of the county from which it was taken, in such manner as may be prescribed by law; and whereas there are in this State counties which have been created out of older counties, which were in debt at the time of the creation of such new county; and whereas there exists no remedy for the enforcement of their said constitutional right; therefore there exists an imperative emer<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gency for the suspension of the rule requiring bills to be read on three several days, and the said rule is hereby suspended, in both the Senate and House of Representatives, and this act shall become a law, and take effect from and after its passage.</p>

<opener>
<salute>An act to amend article 4248, chapter 10, of the Revised Civil Statutes, so as to require the filing of the profiles of all railroads that have not heretofore been filed in the General Land Office, in accordance with said article 4248, and the profiles of all new railroads hereafter constructed, in the office of the Railroad Commission, and the transfer of all profiles heretofore filed in said office to the office of the Railroad Commission, and providing a penalty for the enforcement of the provision of this act.</salute>
</opener>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That each railroad company transacting business in this State that has not heretofore tiled a profile of its road in the General Land Office, in ac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cordance with the provision of article 4248, shall file such profile in the office of the Railroad Commission; and each railroad company that shall construct any railroad in this State hereafter shall file in the office of said Commission a profile of the road constructed. The profiles herein required to be filed in the office of the Railroad Commission, of roads al<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ready completed, shall be filed within three months after the passage of this act, unless in the judgment of the Railroad Commission the facts warrant the giving of a longer period of time, in which event said Com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mission shall have power to extend the time at their discretion, not to exceed twelve months after the passage of this act.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. The Commissioner of the General Land Office shall, upon the taking effect of this act, file in the office of the Railroad Commission the original of all profiles of railroads heretofore filed in said office under article 4248 of the Revised Civil Statutes.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. Any railroad company failing or refusing to comply with the provisions of this act shall forfeit to the State of Texas any sum not less than $500 nor more than $1000, to be recovered in any court of compe<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tent jurisdiction in any county through which such railway company may pass; and each day such railroad company fails or refuses to comply with the provisions of this act shall be considered a separate offense.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. The fact that there is now no law requiring railroads to file profiles of roads with the Railroad Commission, and the importance of such records to said Commission in the discharge of the duties required of it, creates an emergency requiring the suspension of the constitutional rule requiring hills to he read on three several days.</p>

<opener>
<salute>An act to release certain inhabitants of Eastland comity from the payment of State taxes for the year 1893, in consequence of great public calamity.</salute>
</opener>
<p>Whereas, on the night of the 28th day of April, 1893, a terrific storm and cyclone swept over the county of Eastland and destroyed the city of Cisco, and caused great loss of life and much damage to property, both in the city and country surrounding; and whereas, the great loss of life<pb n="600" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="170" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>and destruction of property in said county have produced a great public calamity by rendering homeless many of its inhabitants; therefore,</p>
<p>Section. 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That all citizens of Eastland county who were in any way injured, either in their persons or the person of any member of their families, or in their property, by the said storm, are hereby released from all State ad valorem tax for the year 1893, and the tax collector of the said county is forbid<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />den to collect the same.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. But before any person shall be entitled to the benefit of this, act, he shall go before the county clerk of said county and make affidavit that he was injured by the said storm in his person or the person of some member of his family, or his property. This affidavit he shall deliver to the tax collector of the county, who shall receive the same in full of all taxes due to the State from the person making such affidavit for the year 1893. The tax collector shall forward all affidavits so received to the Comptroller of the State, with his final report, and the Comptroller shall credit the tax collector with the amount of taxes due to the State from the persons named in such affidavits.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. The near approach of the end of the session and the crowded condition of the calendar creates a necessity that the rale requiring bills to be read on three several days be suspended, and it is so suspended.</p>

<p>Article 541a. Towns and villages authorized to incorporate under this chapter, or having two hundred inhabitants or over, not desiring to incorporate for municipal purposes, may incorporate for free school purposes only: Provided, that the territory incorporated shall not exceed an area of sixteen square miles; and when so desiring, an election may be held under the provisions of this title and chapter, and if, at said election, a majority of the votes cast be in favor of the corporation, it shall be the duty of the county judge to make return thereof, and cause a record of the result of such election to be made, the same as provided by articles 512 and 513 of this chapter; upon which entry being made, such town or village shall be regarded as duly incorporated for the pur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pose of establishing and maintaining a free school therein, and shall, upon notice to the State board of education by the board of trustees hereinafter provided for, receive such pro rata share of the available school fund as its scholastic population may entitle it to; and it is further enacted, that all towns and villages heretofore incorporated un<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />der the provisions of said article as it heretofore existed, but which in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />corporation is invalid by reason of having incorporated more territory than a radius of two miles from the center of said town or village, or by reason of having incorporated pastoral or agricultural lands adjacent to such town or village, are hereby declared valid, and all acts of any such incorporated town or village are to be held binding and full force and effect given thereto: Provided, that all towns and villages heretofore incorporated under and by the virtue of the provisions of this chapter, which embrace a radius of three miles from the center of such town or village, but are invalid by reason of having incorporated pastoral or ag<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cultural lands adjacent to such town or village, are hereby declared valid, and all acts of any such incorporated town or village are to be held bind<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing, and full force and effect given thereto: And provided further, that no such town or village shall hereafter incorporate a greater area than sixteen square miles.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. There being many towns and villages in this State that desire to incorporate for free school purposes, and it being important that such incorporation should be duly organized and ready for taking charge of the schools before the next scholastic year; and there being a great many towns and villages in this State that have incorporated more territory than was permitted by pre-existing laws, and which incorporations are invalid by reason of such fact, which creates an emergency and an imperative public necessity for the suspension of the constitutional rule requiring<pb n="606" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="176" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>bills to be read on three several days, therefore said rule is hereby sus<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pended; and this act shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>

And any person who shall continue to pursue said business after such affidavit is filed shall be guilty of a mis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />demeanor, and shall be punished as provided in cases where no license has been procured: Provided, that where the sale is made in good faith, with the belief that the minor was of age, and there is good ground for such belief, that shall be a valid defense to any recovery on such bond.</p>
<p>Sec. 10. That any tax collector, sheriff, deputy sheriff, constable, or other peace officer, having knowledge of the violation of this act, shall report the same to the county attorney, who shall forthwith prosecute any person or persons violating the provisions of this act; and any tax collector whose attention has been called to an instance in which the provisions of this act appear to have been violated, shall investigate the particular case, and if it is found this act has been violated, report the fact to the county attorney or district attorney.</p>
<p>Sec. 11. That any officer who shall willfully refuse or neglect to per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />form the duties required of him by the provisions of this act shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof shall be fined in any sum from one hundred to five hundred dollars, and may be dismissed from office.</p>
<p>Sec. 12.

<p>Sec. 14. All laws and parts of laws in conflict herewith, are hereby re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pealed.</p>
<p>Sec. 15. The evils designed to be remedied by this act creates an emer<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gency and an imperative public necessity for the act to take effect and be in force from and after its passage; and the fact that the Comptroller of Public Accounts is required to send out his blanks by the first day of May, creates an imperative public necessity that this act take effect at once, and it is therefore enacted that this act shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage.</p>
