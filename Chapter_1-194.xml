<p>Sec. 2. Upon receipt of such instruments the clerk shall endorse thereon, the day and hour when the same was deposited in his office for record, and shall keep the same on file in his office for the inspection of all parties interested until satis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />faction thereof shall be entered, as provided in section 5, of this act, provided, that if a copy be presented to the clerk for filing, instead of the original instru<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment, he shall carefully compare such copy with the original and the same shall not be filed unless it is a true copy thereof, and a copy can be filed only when the original has been witnessed by two subscribing witnesses or acknowledged or proven for record and certified as required in case of other instruments for the purpose of being recorded.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. A certified copy of any such instrument so filed as aforesaid, certified to under the hand and seal of the clerk of the county court in whose office the same shall have been filed, shall be admitted in evidence in like manner as the original might be, unless the execution of the original has been denied under oath by the party sought to be charged thereby; provided, that the party desiring to use such instrument shall file the same in the papers of the cause before announc<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing ready for trial and not afterwards; and such certified copy shall in all cases be received as evidence of filing and entry thereof in chattel mortgage record ac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cording to the endorsement of the clerk thereon.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. When the debt secured by any such instrument shall have been paid or satisfied, it shall be the duty of the mortgagee, his assignee, attorney or legal representative to enter or cause to be entered and attested by the clerk, as afore<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />said, satisfaction thereof, in the record book in which the instrument is entered, which may be done under the head of &#8220;remarks,&#8221; and any instrument acknowl<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />edging payment or satisfaction need not be recorded at length, but the entry as above provided showing the same has been paid shall be sufficient, and the original instrument or copy thereof on file shall then be delivered to the mort<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gagor or maker upon demand, or mail the same to him.</p>
<p>The fact that chattel mortgages which have been satisfied are accumulating and required to be kept and preserved in the county clerk&#8217;s office under existing laws, and a simple method of filing and proving chattel mortgages is necessary, makes it an imperative public necessity, and an emergency that the constitu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tional rule requiring this bill to be read on three several days, be suspended and this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage.</p>

<p>Section 1.

<salute>An Act to define, prevent and punish fraud and evasion in the assessment and collection of the public revenue, arising upon money in coin, notes or bonds subject to taxation, and to provide a punishment therefor.</salute>
</opener>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That any evasion by any means of artifice or temporary or fictitious sale exchange or pretended transfer upon any bank books of gold and silver coin, bank notes or other notes or bonds, subject to taxation under the laws of this State, for United States non-taxable treasury notes or any notes or bonds not so subject to taxation, and any such pretended sale, exchange or<pb n="42" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="40" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>transfer not made in good faith, and by actual exchange and delivery of the funds so sold, exchanged or transferred and made only by entry on bank books, or by any express or implied understanding not to immediately make a bona fide and permanent sale, shall be deemed prima facie to be a fraud upon the public revenue of this state.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. The president, cashier or secretary of any banking or other corpora<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion, or any person that may be a party or privy to such fraudulent sale, ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />change or transfer shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be punished by a fine of not less than ten dollars nor more than one hun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dred dollars, and in addition thereto shall be confined in the county jail not less than ten days nor more than thirty days.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. All Assessors of taxes in this state shall require all tax payers when assessed by them, to make oath as to any such sale, exchange or transfer made by them on the first day of January or within sixty days before said first day of January of any year for which any such assessment is made, as to the good faith and bona fide business transaction of any such sale, exchange or transfer, as above set forth, if any such should have been made by them, and if it should be disclosed that any such pretended sale, exchange or transfer have been made for the purpose of evading taxation, then and in that event the assessor shall list and render against such person the coin, bank notes or other notes or bonds subject to taxation under the laws of this state, provided that if any person shall make a false affidavit as to any of the foregoing facts, he shall be deemed guilty of perjury and be punished as is now provided by law.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. The great importance of the subject treated of in this act and the near approach of the time for making assessment for taxes in this state creates an emergency and an imperative public necessity requiring the suspension of the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days, and said rule is so suspended.</p>

<p>The judges of election shall refuse to accept such vote of such elector unless in addition to his own oath, he proves by the oath of one well known resident of the ward, that he is a qualified voter at such election and in such ward.</p>
<p>When such vote is accepted the judges shall cause the clerk of election to make a minute of the name of the elector and the party testifying under oath as to his qualifications, and such memoranda shall be kept by the clerk of the county court for six months after such election is held, subject to order of the district judge.</p>

<salute>An Act to carry into effect the constitutional amendment empowering counties to determine by vote whether 15 cents road tax shall be levied by County Commissioners Court.</salute>
</opener>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That the Commissioners court of any county shall, upon presentation to it, at any regular session, of a petition signed by 200 qualified voters, they being property tax payers of the county, to determine whether there shall be levied upon the property within said county, by said Commissioners court, a road and bridge tax, not to exceed fifteen cents on the one hundred dollars worth of property under the provisions of the amendment of 1889, to the constitution of the State of Texas, adopted in 1890. It shall not be necessary to give any notice of such petition before the court can act on the same, but the court may act thereon without notice, and may make an order for such election, fixing the amount to be levied not to exceed fifteen cents on the one hundred dollars, the election to take place at any time thereafter, not less than twenty nor more than ninety days from the date of making the order therefor.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. It shall not be necessary to give any formal notice of such election, except the County Judge shall issue his election proclamation, and the fact that such election is to be held shall be published in the newspapers of the county as fully as practicable, and tickets for the election shall be printed by the county and sent to each voting precinct by the County Judge before the election opens, and as long before such time as practicable. The expenses of the election shall be paid for by the county. If an election be ordered within ninety days of a general election, it shall be held on the day of the general election, and as elec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="54" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="52" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>tions on other questions are held, but otherwise the commissioners court shall order a special election to determine whether said tax shall be levied, which shall be conducted as other elections, and the officers to conduct the same shall be appointed as in other cases.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. Only qualified voters who pay a property tax in the county shall be permitted to vote at such election. The tickets printed and to be voted shall have written or printed on them the words: &#8220;For the tax,&#8221; and &#8220;Against the tax,&#8221; and those who favor the tax shall vote the ticket &#8220;For the tax,&#8221; and those who oppose the tax shall vote the ticket. &#8220;Against the tax.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sec. 4. If at any such election the majority of the qualified voters voting thereat shall vote for such tax, it shall not be necessary to make further procla<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mation of that fact than to count the votes as in other cases, and officially an<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nounce the result, and the said Commissioners Court shall thereby be authorized and required to levy a road and bridge tax in the same manner that other taxes are levied, in the amount specified in said order for such election, never to exceed 15 cents on the $100.00 worth of property. Such levy shall be made at the same time other county taxes are levied, if such election is held in time therefor, but otherwise, it may be made at any time before the rolls are made out and settlement effected. If, at the election, the proposition for said tax shall carry, no petition for its repeal shall be granted in less than two years. But if it fails to carry, another petition may be granted in one year, but not sooner, and the order granting the second or any subsequent petition may fix a greater or less rate of levy not to exceed fifteen cents on the one hundred dollars worth of property, and if no greater rate is levied for any one year the Com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioners Court may lower the rate for the next year without a petition therefor. An election to repeal the levy may be ordered and held as in other cases, but there must be satisfactory proof presented to said Commissioners Court that there is great dissatisfaction with such tax and that it is probable that a majority of the citizens of the county who are authorized to vote for said tax would vote for a repeal of the law, and unless such proof be made the petition to repeal shall not be granted.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. Provided that no bonds shall ever be issued under the provisions of the act.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. Whereas, there is no law in force in this state putting in operation the amendment to the constitution and to provide for elections to determine whether such tax shall be levied, and whereas, many counties in this state desire to hold such elections and levy said tax at the time of making the general tax levy for the county, therefore an emergency and public necessity exists that this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage.</p>

Until the Commission shall make the classifications and schedules of rates as herein provided for, and afterwards if they deem it advisable, they may make partial or special classifications for all or any of the railroads subject hereto, and fix the rates to be charged by such roads therefor; and such classifications and rates shall be put into effect in the manner provided for general classifications and schedules of rates.</p>
<p>(h.) The Commission shall have power, and it shall be its duty from time to time, to alter, change, amend, or abolish any classification or rate established by it when deemed necessary; and such amended, altered, or new classifications or rates shall be out into effect in the same manner as the originals.</p>

<p>(j.) The Commission shall make reasonable and just rates of charges for each railroad, subject hereto for the use or transportation of loaded or empty cars on its road; and may establish for each railroad or for all railroads alike reasonable rates for the storing and handling of freight and for the use of cars not unloaded after forty-eight hours&#8217; notice to the consignee, not to include Sundays.</p>

<p>Sec. 7. In all trials under the foregoing section the burden of proof shall rest upon the plaintiff, who must show by clear and satisfactory evidence that the rates, regulations, orders, classifications, acts, or charges complained of are un<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />reasonable and unjust to it or them.</p>
<p>Sec. 8. The said Commission shall, so soon as the classification and sched<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ules of rates herein provided for are prepared by them, furnish each railroad sub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ject to the provisions of this act with a complete schedule in suitable form, show<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing the classification of freight made by them and the rates fixed by said Com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mission to be charged by such road for the transportation of each class of freight, and shall cause a certified copy of such classification and schedule of rates to be delivered to each of said railroads at its principal office in this State, if it has such office in this State, and if not, then to any agent of said company in this State, which said schedule, rules, and regulations shall take effect at the date which may be fixed by said Commission, not less than twenty days.

If the Commission find that there has been a viola<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion, it shall determine if the same was willful; if it finds that such violation was not willful it may call upon said road to satisfy the damage done to the complainant thereby, stating the amount of such damage, and to pay the cost of such investigation; and if the said railroad shall do so within the time specified by the Commission there shall be no prosecution by<pb n="62" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="60" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>the State; but if said railroad shall not pay said damage and cost within the time specified by said Commission, or if the Commission find such violation to be wilful, it shall institute proceedings to recover the penalty for such violation and the cost of such investigation. All such complaints shall be made in the name of the State of Texas upon the relation of such complainant. All evidence taken before said Commission in the investigation of any such complaint, when reduced to writing and signed and sworn to by the witness, may be used by either party&#8212;the State, complainant, or the railroad company&#8212;in any proceeding against such railroad involving the same subject matter: Provided further, that the Com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioners may require the testimony so taken before them to be reduced to writing when they may deem it necessary, or when requested to do so by either party to such proceedings, and a certified copy, under the hand and seal of said Commission, shall be admissible in evidence upon the trial of any cause, or pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceeding growing out of the same transaction against such railroad, involving the same subject matter and between the same parties. The provisions of this sec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion shall not abridge nor effect the right of any person to sue for any penalty that may be due him under the provisions of this act or any other law of this State.</p>
<p>Sec. 10. The Commissioners, or either of them, or such persons as they employ therefor, shall have the right, at such times as they may deem necessary, to in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />spect the books and papers of any railroad company, and to examine under oath any officer, agent, or employe of such railroad in relation to the business and affairs of the same. If any railroad shall refuse to permit the Commissioners, or either of them, or any person authorized thereto, to examine its books and papers, such railroad company shall, for each offense, pay to the State of Texas not less than $125 nor more than $500 for each day it shall so fail or refuse: Provided, that any person other than one of said Commissioners who shall make any such demands shall produce his authority, under the hand and seal of said Commission, to make such inspection.</p>
<p>(a) Any officer, agent, or employe of any railroad company who shall, upon proper demand, fail or refuse to exhibit to the Commissioners, or either of them, or any person authorized to investigate the same, any book or paper of such railroad company which is in the possession or under the control of such officer, agent, or employe, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon convic<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion in any court having jurisdiction thereof shall be fined for each offense a sum not less than $125 and not [to] exceed $500.</p>
<p>Sec. 11. The Commission shall ascertain as early as practicable the amount of money expended in construction and equipment per mile of every railway in Texas; the amount of money expended to procure the right of way, and the amount of money it would require to reconstruct the road bed, track, depots and transportation, and to replace all the physical properties belonging to the rail<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />road. It shall also ascertain the outstanding bonds, debentures and indebtedness and the amount respectively thereof, when issued and rate of interest, when due, for what purposes issued, how used, to whom issued, to whom sold, and the price in cash, property or labor, if any received therefor, what became of the proceeds, by whom the indebtedness is held, the amount purport<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing to be due thereon, the floating indebtedness of the company, to whom due and his address, the credits due on it, the property on hand belonging to the railroad company, and the judicial or other sales of said road, its<pb n="63" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="61" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>property or franchises, and the amounts purporting to have been paid, and in what manner paid therefor. The Commission shall also ascertain the amounts paid for salaries to the officers of the railroad, and the wages paid its employes. For the purpose in this section named, the Commission may employ sworn experts to inspect and assist them when needed, and from time to time, as the information required by this section is obtained, it shall communicate the same to the Attor<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ney-General by report, and file a duplicate thereof with the Comptroller for public use, and said information shall be printed from time to time in the annual re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />port of the Commission.</p>
<p>Sec. 12. The said Commission shall cause to be prepared suitable blanks with questions calculated to elicit all information concerning railroads, and as often as it may be necessary furnish said blanks to each railroad company. Any railroad company receiving from the Commission any such blanks shall cause said blanks to be properly filled out so as to answer fully and correctly each question therein propounded, and in case they are unable to answer any question, they shall give a satisfactory reason for their failure; and the said answers, duly sworn to by the proper officer of said company, shall be returned to said Commission at its office in the city of Austin within thirty days from the receipt thereof.</p>
<p>(a.) If any officer or employe of a railroad company shall fail or refuse to fill out and return any blanks as above required, or fail or refuse to answer any ques<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions therein propounded, or give a false answer to any such question, where the fact enquired of is within his knowledge, or shall evade the answer to any such questions, such person shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall on conviction thereof be fined for each day he shall fail to perform such duty after the expira<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion of the time aforesaid a penalty of $500, and the Commission shall cause a prosecution therefor in the proper court; and a penalty of a like amount shall be recovered from the company when it appears that such person acted in obedience to its direction, permission, or request in his failure, evasion or refusal. Said Commission shall have the power to prescribe a system of bookkeeping to be ob<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />served by all the railroads subject hereto, under the penalties prescribed in this section.</p>
<p>(b.) The said Commission shall make and submit to the Governor annual re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ports containing a full and complete account of the transactions of their office, together with the information gathered by such Commission as herein required, and such other facts, suggestions, and recommendations as may be by them deemed necessary, which report shall be published as the reports of the heads of depart<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments.</p>
<p>(c.) The said Commission shall have power, and it is hereby made its duty, to investigate all through freight rates on railroads in Texas; and when the same are, in the opinion of the Commission, excessive or levied or laid in violation of the interstate commerce law, or the rules and regulations of the Interstate Commerce Commission, the officials of the railroads are to be notified of the facts and requested to reduce them or make the proper corrections, as the case may be. When the rates are not changed, or the proper corrections are not made accord<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing to the request of the Commission, the latter is instructed to notify the Inter<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />state Commerce Commission and to apply to it for relief.</p>
<p>Sec. 13. The said Commission, in making any examination or investi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gations provided in this act, shall have power to issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses by such rules as they may prescribe. Each wit<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="64" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="62" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>ness who shall appear before the Commission by order of the Commission, at a place outside of the county of his residence, shall receive for his attendance one dollar per day and three cents per mile, traveled by the nearest practicable route, in going to and returning from the place of meeting of said Commission, which shall be ordered paid by the Comptroller of Public Accounts upon the presenta<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion of proper vouchers, sworn to by such witness, and approved by the chairman of the Commission: Provided, that no witness shall be entitled to any witness fees or mileage who is directly or indirectly interested in any railroad in this State or out of it, or who is in any wise interested in any stock, bond, mortgage, se<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />curity or earnings of any such road, or who shall be the agent or employe of such road, or an officer thereof, when summoned at the instance of such railroad; and no witness furnished with free transportation shall receive pay for the distance he may have traveled on such free transportation. In case any witness shall fail or refuse to obey such subpoena, said Commission may issue an attachment for said witness, directed to any sheriff or any constable of the State of Texas, and compel him to attend before the Commission and give his testimony upon such matters as shall be lawfully required by them. If a witness, after being duly summoned, shall fail or refuse to attend or to answer any question propounded to him, and which he would be required to answer if in court, the Commission shall have the power to fine and imprison such witness for contempt, in the same manner that a judge of the district court might do under similar circum<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />stances. The claim that any such testimony may tend to criminate the person giving it shall not excuse such witness from testifying, but such evidence or testimony shall not be used against such person on the trial of any criminal proceeding: Provided, the Commission shall in all cases have the right in its discretion to issue proper process and take depositions instead of compelling personal attendance of witnesses. The sheriff or constable executing any process issued under the provisions of this section or under any other provisions of this bill shall receive such compensation as may be allowed by the Commission, not to exceed fees as now prescribed by law for similar services.</p>
<p>Sec. 14. If any railroad company subject to this act, or its agent or officer, shall hereafter charge, collect, demand or receive from any person, company, firm or corporation a greater rate, charge, or compensation than that fixed and es<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tablished by the Railroad Commission for the transportation of freight, passen<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gers, or cars, or for the use of any car on the line of its railroad, or any line operated by it, or for receiving, forwarding, handling, or storing any such freight or cars, or for any other service performed or to be performed by it, such railroad company and its said agent and officer shall be deemed guilty of extortion, and shall forfeit and pay to the State of Texas a sum not less than $100 nor more Than $5000.</p>
<p>Sec. 15. If any railroad subject hereto, directly or indirectly, or by any special rate, rebate, drawback, or other device, shall charge, demand, collect, or receive from any person, firm, or corporation a greater or less compensation for any ser<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vice rendered or to be rendered by it than it charges, demands, collects, or re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceives from any other person, firm or corporation for doing a like and contem<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />poraneous service, such railroad shall be deemed guilty of unjust discrimination, which is hereby prohibited.</p>
<p>(a.) It shall also be an unjust discrimination for any such railroad to make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any<pb n="65" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="63" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>particular person, company, firm, corporation, or locality, or to subject any par<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ticular description of traffic to any undue or unreasonable prejudice, delay, or dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />advantage in any respect whatsoever.</p>
<p>(b.) Every railroad company which shall fail or refuse, under such regulations as may be prescribed by the Commission, to receive and transport without delay or discrimination the passengers, tonnage, and cars, loaded or empty, of any con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />necting line of railroad, and every railroad which shall, under such regulations as may be prescribed by the Commission, fail and refuse to transport and deliver without delay or discrimination any passengers, tonnage, or cars, loaded or empty, destined to any point on or over the line of any connecting line of railroad, shall be deemed guilty of unjust discrimination: Provided, perishable freights of all kinds and live stock shall have precedent of shipment.</p>
<p>(e.) It shall also be an unjust discrimination for any railroad subject hereto to charge or receive any greater compensation in the aggregate for the trans<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />portation of like kind of property or passengers for a shorter than for a longer distance over the same line: Provided, that upon application to the Commission any railroad may in special cases, to prevent manifest injury, be authorized by the Commission to charge less for longer than for shorter distances for trans<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />porting persons and property, and the Commission shall from time to time pre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />scribe the extent to which such designated railroad may be relieved from the operations of this provision: Provided, that no manifest injustice shall be im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />posed upon any citizen at intermediate points.

<p>Sec. 16. Any officer or agent of any railroad subject to this act who, by means of false billing, false classification, false weight, or by any other device, shall suffer or permit any person or persons to obtain transportation for property at less than the regular rates then in force on such railroad, or who by means of false billing, false classification, false weighing, or by any device whatever shall charge any person, firm or corporation more for the transportation of property than the regular rates, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof fined in a sum of not less than $100 nor more than $1000.</p>

<p>Sec. 17. In case any railroad subject to this act shall do, cause to be done, or permit to be done any matter, act, or thing in this act prohibited or declared to be unlawful, or shall omit to do any act, matter, or thing herein required to be done by it, such railroad shall be liable to the person or persons, firm, or cor<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />poration injured thereby for the damages sustained in consequence of such vio<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lation; and in case said railroad company shall be guilty of extortion or discrim<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ination as by this act defined, then, in addition to such damages, such railroad shall pay to the person, firm, or corporation injured thereby a penalty of not less than $125 nor more than $500, to be recovered in any court of competent juris<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />diction in any county into or through which such railroad may run: Provided, that such road may plead and prove as a defense to the action for said penalty that such overcharge was unintentionally and innocently made through a mis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />take of fact: Provided, that any such recovery as herein provided shall in no manner affect a recovery by the State of a penalty provided for such violation.</p>
<p>Sec. 18. If any railroad, as aforesaid, shall willfully violate any other provi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sions of this act, or shall do any other act herein prohibited, or shall fail or refuse to perform any other duty enjoined upon it fox which a penalty has not herein been provided, for every such act of violation it shall pay the State of Texas a penalty of not more than five thousand dollars.</p>
<p>Sec. 19. All of the penalties herein provided, except as provided in Section 17, shall be recovered and suits thereon shall be brought in the name of the State of Texas in the proper court having jurisdiction therof in Travis County, or in any county to or through which such railroad may run, by the Attorney-General or under his direction; and the attorney bringing such suit shall receive a fee of fifty dollars for each penalty recovered and collected by him, and fen per cent of the amount collected, to be paid by the State. In all suits arising under this act the rules of evidence shall be the same as in ordinary civil actions, except as otherwise herein provided.

<p>Sec. 20. Upon application of any person the Commission shall furnish cer<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tified copies of any classification, rates, rules, regulations, or orders, and such certified copies, or printed copies published by authority of the Commission, shall be admissible in evidence in any suit and sufficient to establish the fact, that any charge, rate, rule, order, or classification therein contained and which may be in issue in the trial is the official act of the Commission. A substantial compliance with the requirements of this act shall be sufficient to give effect to all the classi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fications, rates, charges, rules, regulations, requirements, and orders made and established by the Commission, and none of them shall be declared inoperative for any omission of a technical matter in the performance of such act.</p>
<p>Sec. 21. It is hereby made the duty of such Railroad Commission to see that the provisions of this act and all laws of this State concerning railroads are en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />forced and obeyed, and that violations thereof are promptly prosecuted, and penalties due the State therefor recovered and collected. And said Commission shall report all such violations, with the facts in their possession, to the Attorney<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />General or other officer charged with the enforcement of the laws, and request him to institute the proper proceedings; and all suits between the State and any railroad shall have precedence in all courts over all other suits pending therein.</p>

But any two connecting railroads may enter into a contract whereby any part or all of the passengers, freight, or cars, empty or loaded, hauled or transported by one and destined to points on or beyond the line of the other shall be delivered to, received and transported by the other; which contract, however, shall be submitted to the Railroad Commission for ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />amination and approval, and when so approved shall be binding; but if the said contract be not approved by the Commission the same shall be void: Provided, that any connecting line delivering freight to the owner or consignee of such freight may be sued by the owner thereof in the county where the freight is de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />livered for any damage that may be done to such freight in its transportation.</p>
<p>Sec. 22. The terms &#8220;road,&#8221; &#8220;railroad,&#8221; &#8220;railroad companies,&#8221; and &#8220;railroad cor<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />porations,&#8221; as used herein, shall be taken to mean and embrace all corporations, companies, individuals, and associations of individuals, their lessees or receivers (appointed by any court whatsoever), that may now or hereafter own, operate, manage, or control any railroad or part of a railroad in this State, and all such corporations, companies, and associations of individuals, their lessees or receivers, as shall do the business of common carriers on any railroad in this State.</p>
<p>(a.) The provisions of this act shall be construed to apply to and affect only the transportation of passengers, freight, and cars between points within this State; and this act shall not apply to street railways nor suburban or belt lines of railways in or near cities and towns.</p>
<p>(b.) It shall be the duty of the Commission to see that upon every railroad and branch of same carrying passengers for hire in this State shall run at least one train a day (Sundays excepted), upon which passengers shall be hauled, and the Commission shall have no power to relax this provision.</p>
<p>Sec. 23. This act shall not have the effect to release or waive any right of ac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion by the State or any person for any right, penalty, or forfeiture which may have arisen or may hereafter arise under any law of this State; and all penalties accruing under this act shall be cumulative of each other, and a suit for or re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />covery of one shall not be a bar to the recovery of any other penalty; and all laws and parts of laws in conflict with this act are hereby repealed.</p>
<p>Sec. 24. The fact that there is no adequate and sufficient law for the regu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lation of railroads in the transportation of freight and passenger traffic, and the near approach of the close of the present session, creates an imperative public necessity and an emergency, necessitating the suspension of the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days, and it is so suspended, and that this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>

</opener>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That each member of the commissioners court of Collin county shall be ex-officio road com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioner of their respective districts and under the direction of the commission<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ers court, shall have charge of all the teams, tools and machinery belonging to the county, and placed in their hands by said court; and it shall be their duty, under such rules and regulations as the commissioners court may prescribe, to super<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />intend the laying out of new roads, the making or changing of roads, and the building of bridges. Each of said Commissioners shall, before entering upon the duties of their office, execute a bond of one thousand dollars with two or more good and sufficient sureties, payable to the County Judge of said county for the use and benefit of the road and bridge fund, conditioned that they will perform all the duties required of them by law or by the commissioners court, and that they will account for all money or property belonging to the county that may come into their possession.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. The commissioners court of said county shall have full power and au<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />thority, and it shall be their duty to adopt such system for working, laying out, draining and repairing the public roads in said county as they may deem best, and from time to time said court may change its plans or system of working. Said commissioners court shall have power to purchase such teams, tools and machinery as may be necessary for the working of its roads. Said court shall have the power to construct, grade, gravel, or otherwise improve any road or bridge by contract; in such case, said court or the County Judge may advertise in such manner as said court may determine for bids to do such work, and the contract shall be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder, who shall enter into bond, payable to the County Judge of said county, for the use of the road and bridge fund, with good and sufficient sureties to be approved by said court, and in such sum as said court may determine, for the faithful compliance with the terms of said contract; but said court shall have the right to reject any and all bids. At the time of making any such contract, the court shall direct the county Treasurer to pass the amount to a particular fund for that purpose, and the Treasurer shall keep a separate account of such fund and the same shall not be used for any other purpose, and can only be paid out on the order of said court, and the said court shall have authority to employ any hands or teams to work on the roads under such regulations and for such price as they may deem best.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. The commissioners court of said county shall require all county convicts not otherwise employed to labor upon the public roads<pb n="69" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="67" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>under such regulations as it may prescribe, and each convict so worked shall receive a credit of fifty cents on his fine first, and then on the cost, for each day he may labor. The commissioners court may at a regular term allow to the officers and witnesses such amount of their cost for the arrest and conviction of said convicts as it may deem best; provided that it shall not allow to any officer an amount greater than the following: County Judge, $3.00; County Attorney, $5.00, including commissions; County Clerks and Justices of the Peace, $1.70; Sheriffs or Constables, $2.00; which amount shall be paid to the officers out of the road and bridge fund, on the warrant of the County Judge, when said fine and costs shall have been worked out as provided in this section; pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided, that this shall not be so construed as to relieve any convict from the payment of all costs for which he would be liable under the general laws of this state. The commissioners court may grant a reasonable commutation of time for which a convict is committed as a reward for faithful services and good behavior. Provided, that such commutation shall in no case exceed one-tenth of the whole time. The commissioners court may provide the necessary houses, prisons, clothing, bedding, food, medicine, medical attention and guards for the safe and humane keeping of the convicts.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. Each county commissioner shall have control of all road overseers in his district and shall deliver to each of them all teams, tools and machinery necessary in working the roads in the district of said overseer, so far as he has been supplied therewith by the commissioners court, taking the receipt of said road overseer therefor, specifying each item and giving its value, which receipt shall be a full answer of the liability of the Commissioner and shall fix the liability of the overseer, and any commissioner or overseer who shall have been entrusted with any teams, tools or machinery, belonging to said county, shall be liable for any damages that may occur to the same while in his possession. It shall be the duty of the road overseer when he has finished the work on his road to return to said Commissioner all teams, tools and machinery received from him and to take up the receipt given therefor.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. It shall be the duty of the county Commissioner when acting as road Commissioner to inform himself of the condition of the public roads in his district, and shall determine what character of work shall be done upon said roads, and shall direct the manner of grading, draining or otherwise improving the same, which directions shall be observed and obeyed by all road overseers of his district.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. The commissioner may require each road overseer in his district to call out the hands in such numbers as may be sufficient to perform the work, but no road hand shall be required to work exceeding five days in any one year, unless the term of service as prescribed by the general laws shall be extended beyond that time, and provided that all the road hands in a particular dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />trict shall, as far as practicable, be worked a uniform time. Each road over<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />seer shall have full control of all road hands within his road district, and he shall see that each hand, when called out, shall perform a good days work, and if any hand when so called out shall fail or refuse to perform a good days work or to work in the manner the overseer may direct, he shall be liable to the same penalty as if he had failed to appear in obedience to the sum<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mons. The commissioners court may allow to any overseer who shall be en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gaged in the discharge of the duties of his office for more than five days during<pb n="70" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="68" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>any one year, a compensation not to exceed one dollar and one-half per day for the time so served.</p>
<p>Sec. 7. Any citizen of Collin county liable for road duty who shall on or before the first day of January of any year pay to the county treasurer the sum of $3.00 shall be exempt from road duty for such year, beginning on the first day of January. The treasurer shall receive and receipt for all money so paid him and place the same to the credit of the road and bridge fund, and he shall keep a separate account for each road district, of all money so received by him, and the same shall be expended in the district from which it was re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceived. The treasurer shall, on the third day of January, or as soon thereafter as practicable, furnish to each county commissioner, a list of all persons in their respective districts that have paid said sum as provided in this section.</p>
<p>Sec. 8. Whenever it shall be necessary to occupy any lands for the purpose of opening, widening, straightening or draining any road or part thereof, if the owner of such land and the county commissioners court can not agree upon the damage to be paid, the county may proceed to condemn the same in the same manner that a railroad company can condemn land for right of way and the same proceedings may be had and the same rights shall exist to each party as would exist if the proceedings were by a railroad company, except that the county shall in no case be required to give bond.</p>
<p>Sec. 9. Each county commissioner when acting as road commissioner and per forming the duties imposed upon him by law or by the commissioners court shall be entitled to two dollars per day for the services actually performed; provided that he shall not receive more than forty-five dollars ($45.00) per quarter when the road and bridge tax has not been levied as provided by law under the amendment of 1889, as adopted in 1890 to the Constitution of the State of Texas. And when said tax shall have been levied, he may receive an amount not to exceed ninety ($90.00) dollars per quarter, which amount shall be paid out of the road and bridge fund when the account shall have been approved by the commissioners court, and the court shall not approve said accounts unless the commissioner presenting it shall first sign an oath that the account is just, due and unpaid, and specifying the number of days work actually performed by him, and that it was necessary to be done, and no commissioner shall be entitled to pay as road commissioner while he is performing the duties of county commissioner.</p>
<p>Sec. 10. This act shall be taken notice of by all courts in the same manner as the general law of the State, and it shall be construed to be cumulative of all general laws of the State on the subject of roads and bridges where not in conflict therewith, but in case of a conflict this act shall control as to the said county of Collin.</p>
<p>Sec. 11. The fact that there is now no sufficient road law in force in this State, creates an emergency and imperative public necessity, that the constitu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days be suspended, and said rule is hereby suspended, and it is so enacted.</p>

<p>Sec. 2. Subject to the orders and control of the Commissioners court, the road Commissioner shall have charge and control of all such teams, wagons, tools and machinery as the Commissioners court shall place in his custody for use on the public roads of said county and shall execute and deliver to the County Clerk of said county his receipt therefor, specifying each item and its value, which shall be filed by the Clerk of the County court in his office, and a certified copy thereof shall be admissible as evidence in any suit against said Commissioner and his sureties or either of them, on his bond for the said property or the value thereof, the same as the original would be.

The road Commissioner may require each road overseer to call out the hands under his direction in such numbers as may be sufficient to use the teams, wagons, tools and machinery allotted to such road district and at such times as may be necessary, but no road hand shall be required to serve in any one year exceeding five days, unless the term of service as prescribed by the gen<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />eral law shall be extended beyond that term. Each road overseer shall have con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />trol of all hands within his road district and subject to road duty, and shall see that each such road hand shall perform his duty in working said roads, and that each hand when called out shall perform a fair day&#8217;s work, and if any hand so called out shall refuse to work in a proper manner, or to do his part of any service assigned to him, such road overseer shall treat him as if he had failed to appear in obedience to the summons, and such hand shall be liable to the same penalties as if he had failed to appear in obedience to the summons. The Commissioners court may allow to any road overseer who shall be engaged in the discharge of the duties of his office for more than five days during any one year, a compensation not to exceed $1.50 per day for the time so served over and above five days, and in addition thereto said court may enter an order ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />empting such road overseer from road duty in said county for the next succeeding year, if his service in the opinion of the court has been of a kind to merit such exemption.</p>
<p>Sec. 7. The Commissioners court of said county shall have full power and authority to adopt such system for working, laying out and repairing the public roads in said county as to said court may seem best, and from time to time said court may change its plans or system of work in such manner as it may deem advisable. The said Commissioners court shall have the power to purchase such teams, wagons, tools and machinery as may be necessary for the working of its public roads and also all material that may be needed therefor, all of which shall be paid for out of the road and bridge fund of said county. The Commissioners court of the county may, in its discretion, work the county convicts of said county upon the public roads, but it shall not pay any costs that may be adjudged against said convicts. As a reward for faithful services and good behavior while engaged at any work upon the public roads, the said Commissioners court shall have the authority to grant a reasonable commutation of time for which any convict would be compelled to work in order to pay his fine and costs, and such court shall make proper rules and regulations to govern and control in the granting of such commutation. The said commissioners court shall have authority to employ such labor as may be necessary to work the public roads of the county, to be paid for out of the road and bridge fund; such labor shall be under the control of the road Commissioner, if one shall be employed, or under such other person or persons as said court may direct and employ for that purpose.</p>
<p>Sec. 8. Every owner of a farm or other lands upon which a hedge of any description grows on or near the line of a public road shall be re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quired to keep the same trimmed so that the height of the same shall not exceed five feet above the level of the ground, and any such owner who shall fail or neglect to so trim such hedge shall be notified in writing by the road overseer of that district to trim such hedge as herein required,<pb n="74" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="72" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>and in case such owner shall, after receiving such notice, fail or refuse to so trim said hedge within a reasonable time, he shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction, shall be fined in any sum not to exceed $20 per week from and after the time that he received such notice, such fine to be paid into the county treasury and to be placed to the credit of the road and bridge fund of said county. If any owner of any farm shall fail or refuse after being notified as herein required to trim his hedge as required by this act, then the road overseer shall cause the same to be trimmed in accordance with the provisions of this act, to be paid for out of the road and bridge fund of the county.</p>
<p>Sec. 9. The Commissioners court of said county may make contracts for all supplies and materials to be used in feeding the hands and teams employed on the public roads and in the work of the same, and may make rules and regu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lations by which the same and all contracts shall be paid by the county, and all persons employed by said court shall be governed by such rules and regulations. The said court, may from time to time, make all necessary rules and regulations for the government of the road Commissioner and all persons employed by said county on the public roads, which rules and regulations shall be entered upon the minutes of the court and a certified copy delivered to each person to be governed thereby. Said court may require of the road Commissioner to make reports at such times and in such manner as may be prescribed by the said court, and any road Commissioner refusing to make such reports shall be removed and shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be fined in a sum not to exceed $100.00.</p>
<p>Sec. 10. Whenever it shall be necessary to occupy any lands, for the purpose of opening, widening, straightening or draining any road, or any part thereof, if the owner of such land and the county cannot agree upon the damages to be paid, the county may proceed to condemn the same in the same manner that a railroad company can condemn lands for right of way, and the same pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceedings shall be had and the same rights shall exist as to each party as would exist if the proceedings were by a railroad company, except that the county shall not be required in any case to give bond.</p>
<p>Sec. 11. This act shall be taken notice of by all courts in the same manner as a general law of the state, and it shall be construed to be cumulative of all general laws of the state on the subject of roads and bridges where not in conflict therewith; but in case of such conflict this act shall control as to the said counties of Grayson, Dallas, Galveston, Brown, Comanche, Mills, Fannin, Travis, Hunt, Hill, Kaufman and Fayette. The term &#8220;roads,&#8221; includes the roadbed, ditches and drains, the bridges and culverts, and every part of such road. The term, &#8220;work and working&#8221; as used herein, shall include the opening and laying out of new roads, widening roads, constructing and building, re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pairing and draining of such roads, and everything that may be done in and about the maintenance of such road.</p>
<p>Sec. 12. The Commissioners court of each of the counties named in this act shall have the right to exercise all the authority and powers herein given, and neither of said counties shall be compelled to employ a road Commissioner, unless the Commissioners court of such county shall deem it advisable so to do; provided, that the Commissioners court of either of the aforesaid counties shall appoint a road Commissioner as herein pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided for, then the county Commissioners of the county, making said<pb n="75" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="73" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>appointment shall not be required to perform the duties required of them by article 4390a, of the revised civil statutes of the state.</p>
<p>Sec. 13. The fact that public travel is greatly impeded by reason of the bad condition of the roads in said counties, and that the Commissioners courts thereof have not the power to enforce the needful system of road work and supervision herein provided for, creates an emergency and imperative public necessity that the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days be sus<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pended, and that this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>

<p>Sec. 2. The District courts of Menard, Hemphill and Coke counties shall have and exercise jurisdiction in all civil and criminal matters and causes over which, by the laws of this state, the County courts of said counties would have jurisdiction, except as provided in section one of his act; and all causes other than probate matters and such as are pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided by section one of this act, be and the same are hereby transferred o the District Courts of Menard, Hemphill and Coke counties; and all writs and processes relating to any civil or criminal matters not included<pb n="76" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="74" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>in the subject matters of jurisdiction prescribed in section one of this act, issued by or out of said courts of Menard, Hemphill and Coke counties be and the same are hereby made returnable to the next term of the District court of said counties.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. The County Clerks of Menard, Hemphill and Coke comities, be and they are hereby required rvithin thirty days after the passage of this act, to make a fair and complete transcript of all entries upon their civil and criminal dockets, heretofore made in causes where by section two are required to be trans<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ferred to the District court of said counties, and delivered the same to the District Clerk of said counties, together with all the papers to such cause pertaining, and all such causes shall be immediately docketed by said District Clerk, and such civil causes so transferred shall stand on the docket of said courts as appear<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ance cases for the next succeeding term, and all criminal cases shall be docketed and disposed of in the same manner as if the same had originally been triable in said District courts.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. This act shall not be construed to in any manner affect judgments heretofore rendered by said County courts of Menard, Hemphill and Coke counties, pertaining to matters and causes by which section two of this act are transferred to the District courts of said counties, but the County Clerks of said counties shall issue all executions and orders of sale as the judgments in such cases require, and such executions and orders of sale and proceedings thereunder shall be as valid and binding to all intents and purposes as though the change had not been made as by section two therein contemplated.</p>

And the Commissioner&#8217;s court shall not approve nor shall the County Treasurer pay the voucher of any County Judge or County Superintendent for his compensation herein mentioned until such Judge or County Superintendent shall exhibit to said court and Treasurer an acknowledgement of the receipt by such State Superintendent of such reports which receipt shall show the amount of compensation due the County Judge or County Superintendent as herein provided, and it shall be unlawful for the Com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioners court to approve any voucher, or the County Treasurer to pay any voucher in excess of the amount certified by the said State Superintendent of public instruction as due said County Judge or County Superintendent.</p>

Provided that in the judgment of the penitentiary board it shall be deemed practicable and can be done without loss to the State; the said board may employ the excess of convicts at labor outside the walls, either under the contract system or state account system under such regulations, conditions and restrictions as it may deem best for the welfare of the state and the convicts; and said board shall, when it has means at its disposal which can be so used, from time to time purchase or lease and equip a farm or farms upon which convicts, suitable for farm-labor who can not be made self supporting inside the walls, shall be worked on state account.

In the formation of such corporation, the requirements of Art. 4100 and so much of Art. 4103 of the Revised Statutes as relates to the affidavit therein provided for may be dispensed with, and words applicable to the case of a purchase may be used and substituted when necessary or proper in the articles of incorporation or elsewhere for or in lieu of words applicable to the building or construction of a railway. And when such corporation has been formed, it shall have the power to purchase, ac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quire, own, maintain and operate such line or lines of railway, and properties per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />taining thereto and all other rights, powers, and privileges given by the laws of this State to Railway Companies, including the right to complete and extend such line or lines of railway and to construct branch lines thereto, and any proposed extension or branch lines may be provided for and included in the original articles of incorporation, or the same may, by amendment thereto at any time thereafter, be projected and provided for by such Company.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. Every railroad company organized under the preceding section of this act, shall take the property so purchased subject to all incumbrances, judgments, claims, suits, claims for damages and for right of way against the old company and subject to all debts and claims for damages, accruing against any receiver which may have been appointed for the old company, to the same extent that such prop<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />erty would have been liable in the hands of the railroad company from which it was purchased, and such new company may be made a party to every suit pending against the company from which it purchased, or which may be pending against any receiver of such company, to enforce any right against such new company, and the new company may be sued to enforce any such rights, without joining the old company or the receiver, and in case any judgment has been rendered against the company from which the purchase is made or against a receiver for such last named company and for which the property is liable, execution may be issued on such judgment against such property in the possession of the new company without any suit therefor. When any corporation shall be formed under the provisions of the first section of this act, service of process may be had upon any agent of such cor<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />poration in the county where suit may be pending.

<p>Whereas, it has been found that said contracts have been made by said land board, in many instances, without a strict compliance with the requirements of the said law whereby the said contracts are rendered invalid and said purchasers have failed to acquire any right under the purchases and contracts so made; and,</p>
<p>Whereas, it is inequitable and unjust that the said parties so acting in good faith, and who have complied with the requirements of said act should be deprived of their equities, so intended to be acquired, and which the State in good faith intended to confer upon them by reason of the failure of said land board to comply with said law, and thus lose the benefit of what they have paid on said contracts, and be deprived of said lands; therefore,</p>

Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That the failure of the land board to comply with the requirements of the act of April 12th, 1883, in placing the free school, university and asylum lands of the State upon the market or in selling the same shall not have the effect to render invalid the right, title or claim of any purchaser of such lands under any contract made with said land board, and in any case in which such purchaser bought but one section of land or who bought not exceeding three sections where the rules and regulations of the land board permitted the pur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />chase of three sections and actually settled upon the same in good faith for the purpose of becoming a bona fide settler thereon and has complied with the require<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments of the said act of April 12th, 1883, the rules and regulations of the land board and the terms of the contract made with such land board, or where such purchaser has complied with the law in such particulars as the rules and<pb n="133" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="131" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>regulations of the land board conflicted with said act. But this act shall not affect the right, title or claim of any person, who has by subsequent purchase from the State, or by contract with any officer authorized to make the same, acquired any right in said land prior to the passage of this act.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. The unsettled condition of titles to lands aforesaid, and the injustice to many citizens that has or may occur from the failure of said land board to comply with the requirements of said law in making said sales, creates an imperative public necessity and an emergency which authorizes the suspension of the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days, and the said rule is hereby suspended, and that this take effect from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>

<p>Sec. 2.

Said in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />spector may appoint one or more deputies, who shall likewise be well versed in scab and other diseases of sheep, who shall take the oath of office prescribed by the constitution, and may lawfully perform the same acts as the inspector of sheep, and the inspector may require of his deputies so appointed bonds payable to himself for the faithful performance of their duty as such deputies.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. Said inspector of sheep shall, within twenty days after re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceiving notice of his appointment and before entering upon the duties of his office, execute a bond with two or more good and sufficient sureties, in a<pb n="143" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="141" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>sum to be fixed by the Commissioners court, not less than one thousand nor more than five thousand dollars, payable to the County Judge and his successors in office, conditioned, that he will faithfully and impartially discharge and per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />form all the duties incumbent upon him as inspector of sheep. Said bond shall be approved by the Commissioners court and be recorded in the office of the County Clerk of the county as other official bonds.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. It shall be the duty of the inspector of sheep or his deputy, to carefully and minutely examine and inspect at any time, sheep in his county or which may be driven into or through his county, and which he has reason to believe, or is informed in writing by any one or more sheep owners of his county, or of any adjacent and contiguous county, is affected with scab or any other infectious or contagious disease; and when one or more sheep affected with scab are found in any flock so inspected, the entire flock shall be condemned by said inspector or deputy and considered as affected with said disease.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. The inspector shall be entitled to receive the sum of two cents per head, unless otherwise provided in this act, for all sheep inspected and con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />demned under the provisions of this act; provided, the inspector shall be entitled to receive only one cent per head of any number be may inspect for any one person, in excess of two thousand head. In no one case shall his fee exceed fifty dollars; such fee to be paid by the owner or person in charge of the sheep so inspected and condemned; provided that when an inspector shall inspect any sheep and find no scab to exist in the flock of sheep so inspected, then the fees for such service shall be paid by the person at whose instance such inspection was made; and provided further, that the inspector shall have a lien upon all sheep so inspected and condemned by him for his fees as provided in this section. Provided further, that if any owner or person in charge of sheep affected with scab or other contagious disease shall report the same in writing to said inspector or his deputy, and that he proposes to take means forthwith to cure such disease, it shall not be lawful for the inspector to inspect such flock within twenty days after such report; provided, that if, after the expiration of the twenty days aforesaid, the said sheep have not been thoroughly cured, then the said sheep shall be subject to inspection as hereinbefore provided.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. It shall be the duty of the inspector of sheep or his deputy to arrest and take in charge any flock or flocks of sheep, the property of owners who do not reside in his county, or have no certain or fixed ranch therein, found traveling through his county, and found after inspection to be affected with scab, and to hold and dip said sheep at the cost of the owner or person in charge of such flock or flocks, until the same shall be cured; and said inspector shall be entitled to recover from the owner or person in charge of such flock or flocks of sheep so held by him, the sum of two dollars per day as compensation for holding such sheep, in excess of inspection fees provided for in section 4 of this act; and said inspector shall have a lien upon all sheep so held by him until all fees and ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />penses for holding and dipping incurred by him are paid, provided that said in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />spector inspector shall not in any case hold said flock or flocks of sheep exceeding twenty days.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. Whenever any flock of sheep in any county in this State has been in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />spected as provided for in this act, and found to be affected with scab, it shall be the duty of the owner or person in charge of such flock, to thoroughly cure the same within twenty days from said inspection.</p>

<p>Sec. 9. Whenever in any comity in this State there shall not be sufficient scab or other contagious, and infectious diseases among the sheep to pay the sheep inspector a fair remuneration, under the fees provided by this act, it shall be lawful for any association of wool growers in such county to pay such inspector such additional sums of money as to them may seem right and proper in order to keep such inspector in the performance of the duties of his office.</p>

Said bid or bids shall state specifically at what price each book will be furnished, and shall be accompanied with specimen copies of each and all books proposed to be fur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nished; provided it shall be required of the bidders to deposit with the Treasurer of the State such sum of money as the Board may require not less than $500, and no more than $2500, according to the number of books each bidder may propose to supply. Such deposit shall be forfeited to the State absolutely if such bidder so depositing any sum shall fail to make and execute such contract and bond as is herein required, within such time as the Board may require, which time shall be stated in the notice advertised.

And it is further provided, that unorganized counties shall be furnished books through the same agency of the county to which said unorganized county may be attached for judicial purposes in the same manner that such organized county obtained the books used therein.</p>

<p>Sec. 10. Any teacher or trustee who shall violate the provisions of this act shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction shall be fined not less than ten nor more than fifty dollars for each offense, and every day of such violation shall be considered a separate offense.</p>
<p>Sec. 11.

<p>Sec. 47. The treasurers of the several counties shall be treasurers of the availa<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ble public free school fund and also of the permanent county school fund for their respective counties. The treasurers of the several counties shall be allowed for receiving and disbursing the school funds one-half of one per cent for receiving, and one-half of one per cent for disbursing. Said commissions to be paid out of the available school fund of the county; provided, no commissions shall be paid for receiving the balance transmitted to him by his predecessor, or for turning over the balance in his hands to his successor; and provided further that he shall receive no commissions on money transferred.

Upon the receipt of the certificate from the State board of education, duly countersigned by the comptroller, showing the pro rata of the available school fund to which his county is entitled under the apportionment, the county treasurer shall present the same to the Collector of taxes for his county, who shall pay to the county treasurer on the first day of each month all school taxes that have come into his hands during the preceding month until the Comptroller&#8217;s coupon draft on the Collector is paid up. The treasurer shall endorse the amounts so paid by the Collector on the proper coupon, and shall also execute and deliver to the Collector duplicate receipts for such payments, and when the whole amount of such coupon shall have been paid the county treasurer shall deliver the same to the Collector in whose hands it shall be a voucher for so much money paid in his settlement with the Comptroller of Public Accounts. In case the State school tax shall not suffice to pay off the apportionment to the county, the county treasurer shall on receipt of notice from the State Superintendent of the amount which can be paid by the State Treasurer on the apportionment to his county, enter upon proper coupon the amount so signified and present the same for collection to the Comptroller of Public Accounts. When the entire amount of the<pb n="150" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="148" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>apportionment to the county shall have been paid, the county treasurer shall deliver the certificate of apportionment receipted in full to the State Treasurer. The County Treasurer upon receiving notice from the State Superintendent of the amount apportioned to his county shall report the same to the County Superintendent, who shall immediately apportion the same to the several districts and school communities according to the scholastic census, and the County Su<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />perintendent shall immediately notify the County Treasurer of the amount ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />portioned to each district and school community. It shall also be the duty of the County Treasurer to keep a separate account with each district and school community showing the amount apportioned according to the certificate of ap portionment, the amount set apart monthly to the credit of each district and school community by the County Superintendent, and the amount paid out to each school and district and school communities; provided, in no case shall the County Treasurer pay out any part of the school fund without the approval of the County Superintendent. All balances of the general fund not appropriated for the current year shall be carried over by the treasurer as part of the general fund for the county for the succeeding year, and balances unexpended or appro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />priated for a school community or a district shall be carried over for the benefit of such school community or district if the community be reorganized for the following year, and if it be not reorganized shall be added to the general fund for distribution for the general benefit of the county at large. All schools both white and colored in the same district and school communities shall be main<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tained the same length of time as near as may be. All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this act are hereby repealed.</p>

Provided no county shall be under the operation of this act whose commissioners court does not appoint a road superintendent or superintendents as herein provided.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. In case such commissioners court shall determine that there shall be one &#8220;road superintendent,&#8221; as provided in the preceding section, such court shall appoint a competent &#8220;road superintendent&#8221; for such county, and in case it is determined that there shall be four superintendents, then such court shall appoint a competent person as &#8220;road superintendent&#8221; for each commissioners precinct in such county.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. Each &#8220;road superintendent&#8221; whether county or precinct, shall, within twenty days after his appointment, take and subscribe the oath required by the constitution, and enter into bond payable to the County Judge and his successors in office, with good and sufficient sureties to be approved by the County Judge, in such sum as may be fixed by the commissioners court, conditioned that he will faithfully do and perform all the duties required of him by law or the commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioners court, and that he will pay out and disburse the funds subject to his control as the law provides, or the commissioners court may direct, which bond shall be filed and recorded as other official bonds and shall not be void<pb n="152" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="150" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>for the first recovery, but may be sued on from time, to time until the full amount is exhausted.</p>
<p>Sec. 4.

The commissioners court may for good cause remove any road su<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />perintendent, and in case of vacancy from any cause may appoint a successor who shall hold his office for the unexpired term.</p>
<p>Sec. 5.

<p>Sec. 6. The road superintendent, subject to the orders and directions of the Commissioners court, shall have the general supervision over all the public roads and highways of his county or precinct, as the case may be, and shall superintend the laying out of new roads, the making and changing of roads therein, the building of bridges therein, (except where otherwise contracted) the working of the roads therein and all repairs to be made on the same, and over all county convicts worked on such roads, but this shall not prevent the commissioners court from employing a person to watch and manage such convicts and direct the work to be done by them. Said road superintendent shall take charge of all tools, machinery, implements and teams placed under his control by the com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioners court and execute his receipt therefor which shall be filed with the county clerk, and he shall be responsible for the safe keeping of all such machinery, tools, implements and teams, and the proper expenditure and paying out of all money belonging to the road fund that may come into his hands, and shall be liable for the loss, injury or destruction of any such tools, teams, implements or machinery unless such loss occurred without his fault, and for the wrongful or improper expenditure of any such money, and upon the expiration of his term of office, or in case of his resignation or removal, he shall deliver all such money and property to his successor or such other person as the commissioners court may direct.</p>

And he shall ascertain the names of all persons subject to road duty in each road dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />trict, and keep a record thereof and report the same to the commissioners court.</p>
<p>Sec. 9. Each road superintendent shall have power, and it shall be his duty to call out all persons liable to work on the public roads at any time and in such numbers as he may deem necessary to work the roads in their respective dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tricts, and he shall utilize all such labor to the best advantage in connection with other labor on the roads. The call shall be summons served in the manner and for the length of time prescribed by the law regulating the calling out of hands by overseers, but no person shall be compelled to work outside of his road district.

He may also contract with any person subject to road duty, for the use of teams, and permit such person to discharge his road duty by the use of such double team; but he shall never allow more than two dollars per day for any team, nor more than three dollars for any hand and double team.</p>
<p>Sec. 10. Each road, superintendent shall make a report, under oath, to the commissioners court, at each regular term thereof, showing an itemized account of all money belonging to the road fund he has received, from whom received, and what disposition he has made of the same, the condition of all roads and bridges in his county or precinct, as the case may be, and such other matters as the court may desire information upon; and shall make such other report at such times as such court may require.</p>
<p>Sec. 11. The commissioners court of any such county is authorized to purchase or hire all necessary road machinery, tools, implements, teams and labor required to grade, drain or repair the roads of such county, and said court is authorized and empowered to make all reasonable and necessary rules, orders and regulations not in conflict with law, for laying out, working and otherwise improving the public roads, and to utilize the labor and money expended thereon and to enforce the same. But no change in any road shall be made that lengthens the same without it is to the benefit of the traveling public or for the protection of private property, and then only upon the unanimous consent of the commissioners court.</p>
<p>Sec. 12. Each road, superintendent shall employ sufficient force to enable him to do the necessary work in his county or precinct, as the case may be, having due regard for the condition of the county road and bridge fund and the quality and durability of the work to be done, and shall buy or hire such tools, teams, implements and machinery as the commissioners court may direct, and he shall work such roads in such manner as the commissioner may direct, and such work shall at all times be subject to the general supervision of the commissioners court.</p>

All such certificates shall be dated, numbered and signed by the road superintendent, and he and the sureties on his official bond shall be liable for all loss or damages caused by the wrongful issue of any such certificate or any extravagance in the amount thereof.</p>
<p>Sec. 14. The commissioners court of any such county may, when deemed best, construct, grade, gravel or otherwise improve any road or bridge by contract. In such case said court or the county Judge may advertise, in such manner as said court may determine, for bids to do such work and the contract shall be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder, who shall enter into bond with good and sufficient sureties for the faithful compliance with such contract, but said court shall have the right to reject any and all bids. At the time of making any such contract the said court shall direct the county treasurer to pass the amount of money stipulated in such contract to a particular fund for that purpose, and the treasurer shall keep a separate account of such fund and the same shall not be used for any other purpose and can only be paid out on the order of said court.</p>
<p>Sec. 15. The commissioners court may require all county convicts not otherwise employed to labor upon the public roads under such regulations as may be most expedient. Each county convict worked on the roads in satisfaction of any fine and costs shall receive a credit thereon of fifty cents for each day he may labor. And the commissioners court may order that the county pay to the officers of court as much as one-half of the costs due them and adjudged against such con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vict, and upon such order such payment shall be made. But no such costs or any part thereof shall ever be paid until such convict has worked out the entire amount of such fine and costs as provided by law, and then only upon a certificate from such county or precinct superintendent to the effect that such costs have been so worked out. The commissioners court may grant a reasonable commu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tation of time for which a convict would be compelled to work to pay his fine and costs, or for which he is committed, as a reward for faithful services and good behavior, and such court shall make proper rules and regulations under which such commutations may be granted.</p>
<p>Sec. 16. The commissioners court may accept donations of money, lands, teams, tools, or labor, or any other kind of property or material to aid in building or keeping up roads in the county, and said court or any road superintendent, by and with the concurrence of the commissioners, may authorize any person to make a drain along any public road, the same to be done under the direction of the road superintendent, or such other person as such court may direct.</p>
<p>Sec. 17. The commissioners court of any county may retain the system, of work<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing hands under road overseers as provided by general laws, and place such over<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />seers under the control of a county or precinct superintendent under such lawful regulations as said court may prescribe or may work with overseers without any superintendent, as may be deemed best.</p>
<p>Sec. 18. The commissioners court of any county in any county in<pb n="155" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="153" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>which a special tax for the maintenance of the public roads is levied and col<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lected, as provided for in section 9, article 8, of the constitution, shall not be compelled to require persons subject to road duty to work on the roads, as pre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />scribed in existing general laws, but in such counties the roads shall be worked wholly by taxation, or by taxation in connection with road service as such court may deem best. In any such county such court may reduce the number of days that persons liable to road duty may be required to work on the roads, but can never increase the same above five days in any year.</p>
<p>Sec. 19. Each road superintendent shall keep an accurate account of all moneys received by him on account of the road or bridge fund, and pay the same over to the county treasurer within ten days after its collection, taking his receipt for the same.</p>
<p>Sec. 20. If any person liable under this act to work upon the public roads after being legally summoned, shall willfully fail or refuse to attend either in person or by able and competent substitute at the time and place designated by the person summoning him, or pay to the superintendent or other person authorized by the commissioners court to receive the same, the sum of one dollar per day for each day he may have been notified to work on the road, or having attended, shall fail to perform good service or any other duty required of him by law, or the person under whom he may work, he shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof fined in any sum of not less than five nor more than twenty five dollars.</p>
<p>Sec. 21. Any road superintendent who shall willfully fail or refuse to comply with any provision of this act or order of the commissioners court shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof, punished by fine of not less than twenty five nor more than two hundred dollars for each offense.</p>
<p>Sec. 22. Any person who shall knowingly or willfully destroy, injure or mis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />place any bridge, culvert, drain, sewer, ditch, signboard, mile post or tile, or anything of like character, placed upon any road for the benefit of the same, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof, punished by fine of not more than five hundred dollars, and shall be liable to the county and any person injured for all damages caused thereby.</p>
<p>Sec. 23. The county superintendent or the precinct superintendent, as the case may be, shall obtain from the tax collector of their counties as soon after the first day of January of each year as practicable, and before the first day of May there<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />after, a full list of the delinquent poll tax payers of such county for the previous year, and the persons so appearing on said list and who are such delinquent poll tax payers shall be subject to road duty for the period of three days during such year, and they shall be summoned, as in other cases, to work the roads in the road district or precinct in which such person may reside, and the per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />formance of the road service provided for in this section shall not exonerate the persons from any other road duty to which the persons performing the same may be subject, but this shall be taken as cumulative.

But any person summoned to work on the road under the provisions of this section may satisfy such summons and be relieved from such duty by paying to the county road or precinct superintendent, as the case may be, three dollars; one third of which sum shall go to the free school fund, and the balance to the road and bridge fund.</p>

<opener>
<salute>An act for the preservation of oysters and oyster beds, and for protecting the rights of persons to the same, and affixing penalties, and providing locations for planting oysters.</salute>
</opener>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That oyster beds shall be public and private; all those not designated as private, shall be public; all natural oyster beds and oyster reefs shall be deemed public. No person shall take or catch oysters from any public beds for market or sale or planting from the first day of May to the first day of September in any year. Any person offending against the provisions of this section, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be fined for each offense not less than $10.00 nor more than fifty dollars.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. When oysters are culled or selected from public beds, those not wanted for market or sale or for family use, shall be planted while alive, by the person or persons taking them, on the beds from which they were taken, or some other bed, public or private, and any person violating the provisions of this section shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be fined for each offense not less than ten dollars nor more than fifty dollars.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. Where any creek, bayou, lake or cove not made a navigable stream by the laws of this State or of the United States, runs through the lands of any person, such person or other lawful occupant shall have the exclusive right to use said creek, bayou, lake or cove for gathering, planting or sowing oysters within the metes and bounds of the original grant or patent of said land; but if said creek, bayou, lake or cove is not included in the survey of said lands, then the exclusive rights of the riparian owner shall extend to the middle of said creek, bayou, lake or cove.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. Any person, who is an actual bona fide citizen of the State of Texas, shall have the right of obtaining a location for planting oysters and making private oyster beds within any public navigable waters of this State, other than those mentioned in section 3 of this act, by designating a square space not ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceeding five hundred and thirty-eight yards square intended by him for such purpose, by not less than four buoys anchored, or four stakes firmly and per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />manently planted, one at each corner of such location and by establishing posted notices of the same on one or more of said corner stakes or buoys, said stakes shall project at least four feet above ordinary tides and shall be not less than six inches in diameter if of wood or three inches in diameter if of iron, and any person so locating as aforesaid shall be protected in his possession thereof against trespass thereon, in like manner as freeholders are protected in their rights for a term of fifteen years after filing with the county clerk his notice of location; provided that no person shall have the right to<pb n="158" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="156" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>locate any of the public oyster beds or oyster reefs within the public navigable waters of this State under this act or under any pre-existing law. All oyster locations made under this act shall expire at the end of fifteen years from the date of filing the notice of location with the county clerk, and said location shall then revert to the State, as if the same had never been located; and pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided further that no person shall locate any private oyster bed in the public navigable waters of this State within one hundred yards of low water mark of any shore without the consent of the riparian owner, said owner only having that right, nor shall any one be permitted in any wise to interfere with navigation by enclosure of said oyster beds.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. At any time not exceeding sixty days after placing in position any one or more of said corner posts or buoys upon one of which shall be placed the notice hereinbefore required, the locator shall file with the county clerk of the county in which his location lies, a notice of his location. The same shall be a notice to whom it concerns that the locator has on a certain date, naming it, located a private oyster bed on a certain space, describing it by such description as will suffice to locate it on the ground or water, and that he has placed posts or buoys as required by law. If such notice be filed before the four corners are designated by posts or buoys, the notice shall so state and be followed in sixty days by a supplementary notice after the four corners are all designated by posts or buoys. Notices of location shall in all cases state that the location described does not conflict with any other private bed, and that it is not on any public bed or oyster reef. The notices filed with the clerk as aforesaid shall further state that the locator is a bona fide citizen of the State of Texas. It shall be signed and sworn to by the locator or his agent; the county clerk shall record such notices in a well bound book to be kept for that purpose, and the original with a certificate of registration returned to the locator. The county clerk shall receive for his services in recording such notices the same fee as is charged for recording deeds. The originals or certified copies from the records shall be admissible in evidence under the same rules governing the admission of deeds or certified copies thereof. When the location lies in more than one county the notices shall be filed in all counties in which the location is situated or otherwise the location will be effective only as to those portions lying in the county or counties in which the notice or notices are filed. Upon complying with the provisions of this act, the right of the locator shall date from the placing of the first post or buoy. All oyster beds planted, created or established in accordance with sections three and four of this act shall be private oyster beds, and the owners of the same shall be entitled to all the privileges and protection of this act, after having caused his claim to be duly posted and recorded in the county clerk&#8217;s office as herein provided.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. That it shall not be lawful for any person to plant or purchase oysters for planting, bedding or depositing or for marketing or for any other purpose whatever, from the first day of May to the first day of September in any year, and if any person shall violate the provisions of this section, or either of them, he shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction he shall be fined for each offense not less than ten nor more than one hundred dollars.</p>
<p>Sec. 7. If any person shall willfully take oysters from a private bed or shall take oysters deposited by one making up a cargo for market or for family use without the consent or permission of the owner thereof,<pb n="159" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="157" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>he shall be deemed guilty of theft, and upon conviction, shall be fined in any sum not less than fifty nor more than two hundred dollars, and by confinement in the county jail for a term of not less than twenty days nor more than twelve months.</p>
<p>Sec. 8. It shall be unlawful for any person or persons to rake, dredge or excavate with machinery any public oyster bed or oyster reefs in the waters of this State. Any person or persons who shall violate the provisions of this section shall on conviction be fined in any sum not less than five hundred nor more than one thousand dollars. Each days violation of any of the provisions of this section will constitute a separate offense.</p>
<p>Sec. 9. Any person who shall willfully deface, injure or destroy or remove any post or buoy, or any part thereof used to designate the corners or boundaries of any private oyster beds without the consent of the owner of said private oyster bed, shall be deemed guilty of malicious mischief and punished accordingly.</p>
<p>Sec. 10. No person, firm or corporation shall ever own, lease or otherwise control more than six hundred and forty acrss of land covered with water, the same being oyster locations in this State, and any corporation that now holds six hundred and forty acres or more of such oyster locations shall not be permit<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ted hereafter to acquire, own, lease or otherwise control more. Provided that no corporation shall own, or lease, or otherwise control any such land covered by water unless such corporation shall be duly incorporated under the laws of this State.</p>
<p>Sec. 11. All laws and parts of laws in conflict with the provisions of this act are hereby repealed.</p>
<p>Sec. 12. The fact that there is no adequate and sufficient law for the protection and preservation of public oyster beds and public oyster reefs, and the near ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />proach of the close of the present session, creates an imperative public necessity and an emergency necessitating the suspension of the constitutional rule requiring all bills to be read on three several days, and it is so suspended, and that this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>

<p>Section 9. That whenever a compromise of the debt of any city or town shall be effected, as hereinbefore provided, and the bonds are delivered to the creditors, a board of liquidation, consisting of five reputable citizens of such city or town, shall be appointed forthwith in the manner following: The mayor of the city or town shall appoint one, the Governor of the State shall appoint one, and the dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />trict judge of the district in which such city or town shall be situated shall ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />point one, the city council of the city or town shall appoint one, and the holders of said indebtedness, or a majority of them, shall appoint one; and each shall fill vacancies in the office of their respective appointees in said board; and in case of failure, neglect or refusal of any one or all of said officers to appoint a member of said board, or to fill vacancies therein then the holders of said bonds, or any one or more of them shall have the right to apply to the district court of the district in which such city or town shall be situated, or to the Judge thereof in vacation, for the appointment of a member or members of said board necessary to complete the same, and it shall be the duty of said court or judge to make said appointment. The members of said board shall serve without compen<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sation and shall hold their offices for the term of four years and until their suc<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cessors are appointed and qualified. Each member of said board shall take an oath to faithfully perform the duties of his office. A majority of said board shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Said board, or a majority thereof, shall select some solvent depository for all moneys coming under their control, as hereinafter provided, and for whose acts they shall be responsible, and shall, in writing signed by them, notify the Collector of taxes of said city or town of said selection. It shall thereupon become the duty of such Collector to deposit at the close of business each day one half of all moneys collected by him for the twenty-four hours next preceding, on account of all the taxes of whatever nature levied by said city or town, with the said depository, whose receipt therefor shall be an acquittance to said collector; and said collectors shall be liable on their official bonds for any failure to promptly make such deposits and for ten per cent per month of such amounts, and in addition thereto as penalty; which sums may be recovered by said board of liquidation in a suit therefor; and it shall be<pb n="161" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="159" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>their duty to promptly institute such suits. But whenever the total of said deposits shall equal the annual interest on said bonds it shall be lawful for such collector to discontinue said deposits until he shall be notified in writing by said board that said deposits are reduced below that sum. Said funds of cities or towns shall be subject to the order of said boards of liquidation, and shall be applied by them to the payment, first, of the interest on said bonds as the same matures; and, secondly, to the payment of the principal thereof; and thirdly, to the payment of interest on any valid bonds issued by such city and not em<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />braced in any issue of bonds issued under the provisions of this act, and fourthly, to the payment of the principal of bonds of the character last referred to on the maturity of same. The members of said board shall be liable for the prompt pay<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment of said interest out of said funds, and in case of failure or refusal they shall, in addition, be liable to ten per cent of the amount of such interest as damages to be recovered by any person aggrieved thereby, in any court of com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />petent jurisdiction. Whenever there shall be in the bands of such depositories a sufficient sum to pay two per cent of the principal of said bonds in addition to one year&#8217;s interest it shall be the duty of said board of liquidation to use the same in the purchase of outstanding bonds, provided in section 6 of this act, which bonds when so purchased shall be canceled and shall together with all coupons which have been paid be returned to the council of the city or town. Expenses incurred by said board in advertising for purchase of bonds shall be paid out of said funds. Said boards shall make semi-annual reports to the said councils of their acts and of all receipts and disbursements of moneys coming under their control.</p>

</opener>
<p>Whereas, Deep water harbors, navigable channels, docks and wharves on the gulf coast of Texas are of great importance to the development and prosperity to the State of Texas and the entire northwest; now, therefore,</p>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That any corporation organized under the laws of Texas, which is now authorized or which may hereafter be authorized by an act of Congress of the United States to con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />struct, own, operate or maintain with private capital, a deep water harbor, navi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gable channel, docks or wharves on the gulf coast of Texas, shall be permitted to purchase from the State of Texas at two dollars per acre so much of any public lands, islands, shores or shallow bays belonging to the State of Texas that may be situated within one-half mile from any point or points on the construction works of any jetties or any such deep water channel leading into the main harbor from the open sea; provided, that in no case shall such strip or body of land be more than one-half mile in width, and such person, company or corporation may also purchase from the State at the same price per acre any lands, shores, islands or shallow bays within one-fourth mile of each side of every navigable channel, that such company or corporation may construct through or across such shallow bays in the prosecution of such work.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. Any such company or corporation owning in whole or in part any lands fronting or abutting upon any shallow bays in which any such work is being constructed, may purchase at the same price per acre any lands, shores or shallow bays adjoining and lying in front of such lands; provided, that such pur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />chase shall not extend into such bay so as to include land covered with water having an average depth of more than three and one-half feet at mean low tide. That the purchasers under the provisions of this section shall not extend a greater distance along the front of the survey on the shore than three miles nor a greater distance into the bay than one-half mile; provided, that the islands known as Tolly island and Lydia Ann islands, situated in Aransas Bay, shall not be sub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ject to purchase under the provisions of this act; provided, that one-half of the proceeds of the sale of the lands as provided for in this act shall belong to the permanent free school fund of this State.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. All applications of a purchaser to buy under the provisions of this act shall be made in writing to the Commissioner of the Gen<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />eral Land Office, accompanied by one-fifth of the purchase money, and also by a copy of the act of Congress authorizing the construction of such deep<pb n="169" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="167" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>water harbor, navigable channel, docks or wharves, and a complete plat or map showing the location and design of such improvements, and said plat or map shall also show the public lands, shores, islands and shallow bays applied for, and the depths of such shallow bays in feet, determined by actual survey or as shown by the United States coast survey map.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. Upon the payment of one-fifth of the purchase money as hereinbefore provided, the Commissioner of the General Land Office shall issue a receipt there<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />for, and attach thereto a copy of the application and plat filed by said purchaser, which said receipt shall be sufficient authority to the proper county surveyor to survey the lands, shores, islands or shallow bays sold; provided, that the re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mainder of the purchase money may be paid at any time within five years after date of first payment, and deferred payments shall bear interest at the rate of five per cent per annum payable annually. If any individual, asssociation of indi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />viduals, company or corporation purchasing any land, island or shallow water bays, under this act shall fail to secure twenty feet of water over the bar between the Gulf of Mexico and the main harbor within five years from the date of such purchase and maintain said twenty feet of water continuously for two years, then all such rights shall revert to the State. If the purchaser of any island, shallow water bay, land or either under this act, shall fail to pay the annual in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />terest upon any part of the purchase money when such interest shall become due, or if such purchaser shall fail to pay the principal when the same shall become due, then all rights acquired under such purchases shall be forfeited with all pay<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments made thereon, without any judicial ascertainment of such forfeiture, and the Commissioner of the General Land Office shall indorse upon the contract of purchase, that the same is forfeited, whereby all rights so acquired shall be for<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />feited and revert to the State.

<p>Sec. 5. Any corporation organized under the laws of this State which has such authority as mentioned in the first section of this act conferred upon it by act of the Congress of the United States, may construct, own and maintain, upon the gulf coast of Texas, in connection with its deep water harbor and navigable channels, docks and wharves and navigable channels for the accommoda<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion of commerce, and such corporation may charge, demand and receive reasonable and just tolls, and charge for the use of such docks and wharves; but all navigable channels so constructed shall forever remain open and free to all vessels without fee or charge; the tolls and charges for the use of said docks and wharves shall be equal, just and uniform to all vessels, persons and corporations without discrimina<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion as to amount charged or delay in handling the same, and all such tolls and charges shall be under the control of the Legislature of the State of Texas; and until otherwise directed by the Legislature shall be subject to control and regula<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion by the Railroad Commission under the rules prescribed for the regulation of railroads so far as applicable.

Nothing herein shall be construed to affect any rights acquired before the passage of this act. The acceptance of this act or the exercise of any rights or privileges granted in this act by said corporation or any person or cor<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />poration holding under the same, shall be deemed and held to be a contract with the State; that any wilful violation of the provisions of this act, or the doing of any act herein prohibited, shall work a forfeiture of all rights acquired under this act so far as then held or claimed by the person or corporation guilty of such vio<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lation.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. The privileges and rights granted in this act shall never be exercised so as to in any way hinder or interfere with the completion of any railroad heretofore chartered to be built to and upon Harbor Island, in and upon the location desig<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nated in such charter; nor with any such railroads acquiring and controlling all necessary depot grounds, wharf grounds and deep water fronts that it may or could have acquired legally, had not this act been enacted.</p>
<p>Sec. 7. Before any rights can vest in any corporation by virtue of any purchase of public lands, islands, shores or shallow bays, the said corporation shall file with the Secretary of State a release to the State of Texas of all claim or right to have its tolls or charges imposed for any use to be made of such property or structures thereon regulated by any act of Congress now existing or hereafter to be passed.</p>

<p>Sec. 2.

<p>Whereas, the twentieth Legislature of this State, by an act approved March 17, 1887, so amended article 711 of the Revised Civil Satutes defining the boundary of Aransas county as to detach from San Patricio county and annex to Aransas county, more than eighty square miles of territory, without the proposition for such change having been first submitted to a vote of the people of both counties as prescribed by the constitution of this State; and,</p>

<p>Sec. 15. Whenever the commissioners court of any county has reason to believe that they are threatened at any point or place within or without the county limits with the introduction or dissemination of a dangerous, contagious or in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fectious disease that can and shall be guarded against by quarantine, direct their county physician to declare and maintain said quarantine against any and all such dangerous diseases; to establish, maintain and supply stations or camps for those held in quarantine; to provide hospitals, tents or pest houses for those sick of contagious and infectious disease; to furnish provisions, medicine and all Other things absolutely essential for the comfort of the well and the convalescence of the sick.

<p>(Sec. 18. All laws and parts of laws in conflict herewith are hereby repealed, and all penal statutes heretofore enacted to punish violators of quarantine laws and rules shall remain in full force.</p>
<p>Sec. 19. There being no law upon the subject of quarantine adequate to the protection of public health, and the near approach of the season of the year when quarantine will have to be declared, a public necessity and an emergency exists, requiring the suspension of the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days, and that this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>
