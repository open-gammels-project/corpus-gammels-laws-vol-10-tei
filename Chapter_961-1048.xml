<p>After the passage of such resolution for the paving, repairing, repav<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing or otherwise improving any street or streets or parts of streets, it shall then be the duty of the city engineer to make an estimate of the quantities of the various items of work to be done under said resolu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion, said estimate of quantities to be made by the street or parts of streets, and on which estimate of quantities all bids may be canvassed to determine the gross bid of various bidders on each streets. After said estimate is completed, it shall be the duty of the city engineer to report therewith to the city council detailed plans and specifications for the work embraced in said resolution: Provided, however, that it shall be the duty of said board of public works to examine said specifications and a majority of the members thereof shall endorse their report in reference to the same thereon or affix it thereto before the same are ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />proved by the city council: Provided, further, however, that said city council shall, nevertheless, have the right, after such report shall have been made by the board of public works, to amend or change said spec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ifications without further reference to said board. Specifications for paving shall embrace not less than three standard materials, i. e., stone, brick and asphaltum. The city council may amend or change said spe<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cifications before adopting the same, which specifications, when adopted by the city council, shall be opened for public inspection in the office of the city secretary or that of the city engineer; and it shall be proper to provide in the said specifications for such reasonable alterations in the grade, plan, form or dimensions of the work, or additions to the same, as may become apparent or found to be necessary or expedient by the city engineer or board of public works, as the work referred to in the same progresses.</p>

All proposals shall be addressed to the city secretary and opened in the presence of the city council at a regular meeting.

After bids are received by the city council the city engineer and the city secretary shall make a statement in writing to the city council fixing the approximate cost of doing the work with the several materials and under the different bids. It shall then be the duty of the city council to allow property owners liable to be assessed for said improvements fifteen days time to designate by petition to the city council the material to be used, and if the owners of the majority of all the front feet of property liable to be assessecd for said improvement shall petition for any particular materials named in resolution, then the materials so designated shall be used and said preference of said majority shall control in the letting of the contract or contracts, and the council shall award the contract for the particular material designated by choice of the majority in front feet of the property owners to the lowest and best bidders, in the dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cretion of said council.

<p>That section 28 shall be amended so as to read as follows:</p>
<p>Section 28. Division and Rate of Interest of Assessments.&#8212;The sum assessed against each separate lot or tract of land, when not divided into lots, described in the roll of ownership shall bear interest at the rate of six per cent per annum from the first day of the month next after the acceptance by the city council of the work embraced in said roll, and shall be divided by the city secretary into annual installments not less than three nor more than ten, as may be provided by the resolution au<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />thorizing said assessments, and of as nearly equal amounts, not less than ten dollars each, as he may deem most convenient, and he shall add to each installment the amount of interest to become due on the entire amount of principal unpaid at the maturity of said installment, and the sum so computed shall constitute the total amount due each year re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />spectively on said tract of land: Provided, that when the amount as<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sessed against any particular piece of property is less than thirty dollars and more than twenty dollars, the same may be divided into two install<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments, and when less than twenty dollars a single certificate may be is<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sued therefor.</p>
<p>Amend section 30 by erasing the entire section and substitute the fol<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lowing as section 30:</p>
<p>Section 30.

Said bonds and warrants shall be subscribed by the mayor and attested by the city secretary and the seal of the city, and registered by the city treasurer; the same to be payable only out of the moneys collected on account of the assessments made for said im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />provements respectively; and said bonds shall not be an obligation of said city except out of said fund.

<p>Whenever considered prudent by the city treasurer he may, and when<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ever funds be in his hands to the credit of any improvements exceeding six months interest on unpaid principal he shall, by advertisement for five days in some daily newspaper of general circulation published in the city of Houston, call in a suitable number of the bonds or warrants of the same district for payment, and at the expiration of thirty days from the first publication of said notice, interest on the bonds or warrants so called shall cease; and the notice shall specify the bonds or warrants so called by number, and all bonds or warrants shall be called and paid in their numerical order. The holder of any bond or warrant may at any time furnish his postoffice address to the city treasurer, and in such a case a copy of said advertisement shall be mailed by the city treasurer to the holder of the bonds or warrants called at said address, on the first day of said publication.</p>
<p>All special assessments for such improvements shall be collected by the city treasurer, by suit if necessary, directly from the assessment rolls, and shall be noted thereon and receipted for by him as city treas<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />urer; and under no circumstances shall any abatement of principal or interest be made in favor of any person or property liable therefor on said rolls.</p>

<p>Section 48. The city council may continue annually to assess, levy and collect the special tax provided by ordinances passed by the city council of said city on the second day of June, A. D. 1888, for the pur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pose of paying the interest and principal of the various outstanding bonds issued by the city of Houston, and may by ordinance assess, levy and collect annually upon all property, real and personal, in the city of Houston, not exempt from taxation, such additional tax, not exceeding one and one-half per cent ad valorem, as the interest of the city may re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quire for other purposes: Provided, that if the council should fail or neglect to pass a tax ordinance for any one year levying the taxes for that year, that the tax ordinance last passed will be considered in force, and the failure to pass such ordinance shall in nowise invalidate the collection of the tax. It may also determine when taxes shall be paid by corporations or by individual corporators, and levy, assess and collect upon each male citizen of the city over the age of twenty-one years an annual poll tax of one dollar. All taxes upon real estate shall be a lien and charge upon the property, which lien may be foreclosed and the tax collected by suit in any court having jurisdiction. All taxes not paid within the time prescribed by the ordinances shall bear interest at the rate of six per cent per annum.</p>
<p>All real and personal property held, owned or situated in the city of Houston shall be liable for all taxes due by the owners thereof, including taxes on real estate, personal property and poll tax. All personal prop<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />erty may be levied upon, seized and sold by the assessor and collector for any taxes that may be due, without further warrant of authority than the production of his tax roll, which sale when made shall convey a perfect title to the purchaser thereof; or the amount of the tax may be sued for in any court having jurisdiction, and a personal judgment be recovered against the delinquent tax payer, or against any person to whom the personal property on which the city tax is due has been sold, or who owns, holds and claims possession of said personal property.</p>
<p>It shall be the duty of every person owning or holding property in the city of Houston to render to the assessor and collector of taxes at his office in said city annually, within the time prescribed by the ordinances of said city, a full and complete inventory of all property so owned or held by him, whether real or personal, and to take and subscribe an oath as to the correctness of such inventory, which oath may be administered by the assessor and collector in person or by deputy.</p>
<p>All taxes shall be payable at the office of the assessor and collector;<pb n="972" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="8" /><fw type="header" place="top">Special Laws of Texas.</fw>and no demand by him be requisite or necessary to enforce the collection thereof by any proceedings herein prescribed, nor for any taxes due be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fore the passage of this act. The assessor and collector shall inventory and assess all property which the owners thereof may fail or refuse, or may have failed or refused, to inventory and assess for previous year, which inventory and assessment when so made by him shall be as valid and effective as if made by the owner thereof.</p>
<p>Section 49. That the license tax shall be collected by the assessor and collector of taxes and shall be paid to that officer in current funds of the United States by each and every person or firm owning [owning] such license, and before engaging in any trade, profession, business, calling, avocation, or occupation subject to such tax, taking his receipt therefor, which receipt shall entitle him, her or them to a correspond<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing license to be issued by the mayor.</p>
<p>And if any person shall engage in any business, calling, avocation or occupation which by an ordinance of said city is subject to a license tax without first having obtained such license, he, she or they shall be liable to arrest and imprisonment and a fine of ten ($10) for each and every day such violation of said ordinance may continue; and this sec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion shall apply to all persons owing license and failing to pay the same; and the city council may make such further regulations as it deems necessary to enforce the provisions of this section, and punish the vio<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lation thereof.</p>
<p>That paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of section 50 shall be amended so as to read as follows:</p>
<p>Section 50. That the city council may and shall have full power to provide by ordinance for the prompt collection of all taxes levied, as<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sessed and due or becoming due to said city, and to that end may and shall deem necessary to the levying, laying, imposing, assessing and col<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lecting of any of said taxes, and to regulate the mode and manner of making out tax lists and inventories, and the appraisement of property thereon, and to prescribe the oath that shall be administered to each person on such rendition of property, and to prescribe how and when property shall thus be rendered, and to fix the duties and define the powers of the assessor and collector of taxes.</p>
<p>All taxes due by property owners, as appears upon the tax rolls of said city, may be collected by suit from delinquents, and foreclosure of the lien thereon in any court having jurisdiction of the same; and any per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />son who shall purchase property encumbered with a lien for taxes shall be deemed as to such taxes a delinquent, tax payer, and such purchaser takes the property charged with a lien, and he can not interpose any defense which his vendor might not, had he continued to be the owner.</p>
<p>The city of Houston has the right to maintain a suit to recover a per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sonal judgment for the amount of the tax due it, and the tax may be collected by sale of the particular property on which it is assessed, by enforcing the lien or by the sale of that or other property under a judg<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment of the court, or by seizure and sale of personal property. The as<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sessment rolls shall be taken as prima facie evidence of the statements made therein and that all the prerequisites required by law pertaining to the levying and assessing of taxes have been complied with, and all questions as to misnomer, proper parties to the suit for taxes, misdescrip<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion, and to suits against unknown owners, shall apply in favor of the<pb n="973" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="9" /><fw type="header" place="top">Special Laws of Texas.</fw>city of Houston, and no person shall be permitted to question the same until all taxes due upon the property have been paid. No delinquent tax payer shall have the right to plead in any court or in any manner rely upon any statute of limitation by way of defense against the pay<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment of any taxes due from him or her to the city of Houston.</p>
<p>In no case shall the city council, or any member of the city council, or officer of the city, remit, discount or compromise any tax legally due the city. The city shall have equal right to become the purchaser at all sales of property under judgment or otherwise for taxes due it. All taxes shall be due and payable on the first day of July of each and every year, and if not paid by the first day of January thereafter, the same shall bear interest from the said first day of January until paid, at the rate of six per cent per annum. It shall be the duty of all persons from whom such taxes are due to call and pay the same to the city assessor and collector of taxes at his office in the city of Houston, between the said first day of July and the first day of January next thereafter. Im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mediately after the first day of January in every year it shall be the duty of the assessor and collector of taxes to prepare a roll containing a de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />scription of all the property described in the assessment rolls of the next preceding year, that is to say, of the year ending on the next pre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceding thirty-first day of December, on which the taxes have not been paid. Said roll shall be called the &#8220;delinquent roll,&#8221; and shall consist of a copy from the assessment rolls of so much of the lien on which the tract of land or property on which the tax remain unpaid as will iden<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tify the property and show the amount of taxes due on the same.</p>
<p>During the same time that the city assessor and collector shall prepare the &#8220;delinquent roll" above described, he shall prepare separate state<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments of tax accounts due the city, to be furnished the city attorney on which to bring suits, which statement shall contain the description of the property, the year for which the tax is due, the amount of tax due, the rate of taxation, and the person or persons, estate, firm or corporation who assesses the same, or whether the property is rendered, unrendered, or owner is unknown, as appears from the tax rolls: Pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />viding, that where several tracts of land and different kinds of prop<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />erty are assessed by the same person, firm, estate or corporation, that they may be contained in the same statement; which said delinquent roll shall be finished and said statements furnished not later than the thirty-first day of March of each year; said delinquent roll shall be published during the month of April following, once a week for four weeks, in some daily paper published in the city of Houston, and a failure to comply with these provisions by the city assessor and col<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lector of taxes shall be deemed a malfeasance, and be cause for im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />peachment. Upon receipt of the above tax statements by the city at<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />torney, he shall as soon as possible institute suit in the proper court to enforce the collection of taxes due the city, and shall file suit on all of said statements furnished him by the city assessor and collector of taxes by the next first of October after he has received them, and the failure on the part of the city attorney to file suits on said statements by the first of October shall be deemed a malfeasance and be a cause for impeachment; but a failure on the part of the city assessor and collector of taxes to prepare the &#8220;delinquent roll" or furnish tax statements to city attorney, or a failure on the part of the city to file suits within the proper time, shall in nowise affect the liability of the delinquent tax<pb n="974" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="10" /><fw type="header" place="top">Special Laws of Texas.</fw>payer, or shall such failure in any manner be relied on by way of defense against the payment of taxes due the city. A board of appraisement shall be appointed by the mayor and confirmed by the council and shall continue to act as such board until their term of office as aldermen has expired; and all matters pertaining to taxation shall be referred to the said board, from whose final decision there shall be no appeal. The board appointed by the present administration at its commencement in 1894 is hereby constituted the board of appraisement and shall continue to serve as such until their present term as aldermen shall expire.</p>
<p>That section 58 shall be so amended as to read as follows:</p>
<p>Section 58. Public Work to be Done by Contract&#8212;Exception.&#8212;That all works of improvements and public works for said city, the cost of which will exceed the sum of one thousand dollars, shall be let out to the lowest and best bidder, in the discretion of the council, by sealed proposals; and no contract shall be made or entered into until the plans and specifications for such work or improvements shall have been pre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pared and submitted to the council and adopted by it, and an adver<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tisement published in at least four issues of some daily paper published in the city inviting bids therefor, providing that owners of abutting property shall have the right to pay cash for all improvements, and pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />viding that bids shall state the price at which the work will be done if paid for in cash, and also the price if district improvement bonds or warrants be issued therefor, and stating the time when such sealed pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />posals will be opened: Provided, that if no bids be received, or those re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceived be rejected by the city council, the city may, in its discretion, proceed to have such work or improvement done under the direction of a committee from the membership. City printing and all repairing of bridges or other similar work, of which it is manifestly impossible to make specifications, are not embraced in this requirement. No bids shall be considered unless made in accordance with the plans and speci<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fications, and no allowance for extra work shall ever be made or paid for. The sealed proposals shall be addressed to the city secretary, and shall be opened only in the presence of the city council at a regular meeting. Bond and security, to be fixed and approved by the city coun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cil, shall be required of all contractors.</p>
<p>That section 59 be amended in the fourth paragraph of said section so that it shall read as follows:</p>
<p>Interest and Sinking Fund to be provided for.&#8212;The ordinance au<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />thorizing any bonds to be issued shall also provide a fund to pay the in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />terest and create a sinking fund sufficient to pay the bonds at maturity, and said sinking funds shall be invested in bonds of the city or in United States bonds, and neither said interest nor sinking fund shall be diverted to any other purpose whatever.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. That this act shall be deemed a public act, and judicial no<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tice shall be taken thereof in all courts. No general law hereafter passed by the Legislature of the State shall be held to repeal any power herein granted or which is now vested in the corporation of Houston, unless the act conferring such power be specially referred to in such re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pealing act.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. Whereas, there are no adequate laws in force providing for the paving, improving and repairing of the streets and sidewalks of the city of Houston, there exists an imperative public necessity for suspend<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several<pb n="975" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="11" /><fw type="header" place="top">Special Laws of Texas.</fw>days, and an emergency exists which requires this act to take effect from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>
<p>[Note.&#8212;The foregoing act was presented to the Governor of Texas for his approval on the 3rd day of April, A. D. 1895, but was not signed by him nor returned to the house in which it originated with his objections thereto within the time prescribed by the Constitution, and thereupon became a law without his signature.&#8212;Tom C.

<p>Section 128. The board of public works, before beginning any such improvement, shall, for the purpose of acquiring the most reliable infor<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mation practicable of the probable cost thereof, cause an estimate to be made of said probable cost by the city engineer or by some other officer of the city, or by a committee of the board; and such officer or commit<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tee shall also report a full list of all fronting or abutting lots, with num<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ber and size of same and number of block in which situated, and the name of the owners thereof, and such other information as may be re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quired by the city council; and if it be a street or avenue the improve<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment whereof is contemplated, and any person, corporation or company owns or operates a street railway or railway of any kind thereon, such officer or committee shall also report in said list the name of such per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />son, corporation or company, and if there be any lot or fractional lot the owner whereof is not known the same shall be entered in said list as un<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />known; and said officer or committee shall enter in said list opposite each lot or fractional lot lying and being on each side of the street, ave<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nue or alley the improvement whereof is contemplated, or if the im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="989" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="25" /><fw type="header" place="top">Special Laws of Texas.</fw>provement of a sidewalk is contemplated, then opposite each fronting or abutting lot or fractional lot, such portion or so much of the esti<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mated cost or expense of such work or improvement on said avenue, street, alley or sidewalk as the owner of said lot or fractional lot is re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quired under the provisions of section 127 of this charter to pay, and shall also enter into said list opposite the name of the person, corpora<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion or company owning or operating such railway or railways such portion of the cost or expense of such work as is under section 127 chargeable to said owner or operator. Upon consideration of said re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />port of said officer or committee the council, to whom the same shall be submitted, shall determine whether or not the said work or improvement shall be made, and shall proceed accordingly. When said work or im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />provement is ordered by the council and shall have been completed the board of public works shall cause an accurate report of the cost thereof to be made by said officer or committee to the city council. As part of said report said officer or committee shall present a list of the lots or fractional lots lying and being on each side of the street, avenue or alley so improved, or in case of a sidewalk then of the lots or fractional lots fronting or abutting thereon, and upon such lists of lots or fractional lots shall be entered opposite each lot or fractional lot such portion or so much of the actual cost and expense of such work or improvements on said avenue, street, alley or sidewalk abutting, fronting, adjoining or opposite such lot or fractional lot as the owner thereof is required under the provisions of section 127 of this charter to pay; and opposite the name of the person, corporation or company owning or operating the railway on the avenue or street or portions thereof so improved the cost and expense chargeable to said person, corporation or company under the provisions of section 127 of this charter; and upon the acceptance and approval of said report and list by the city council, said amount shall be imposed, levied and assessed by the said council on or against said lots or fractional lots, and on or against the road bed, ties, rails, fixtures, rights and franchises of said railways respectively, and shall be collected by the collector as herein provided, and shall be a lien upon the property until paid.</p>
<p>Section 129. That after such action on the part of the city council as above provided for the collector shall give notice of the first installment of said assessment being due, and within what time payable, and shall commence forthwith to collect the same and shall annually thereafter give thirty days notice and then proceed to collect the installments as they fall due. That after the expiration of the period for payment of said assessment or any installment thereof said officer shall levy on so much of any property on said list on which any installments have not been paid as will be sufficient to pay the same, and the same notice of sale as is required in sales for taxes shall be given. And if said as<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sessment or unpaid installments are not paid before the day of sale, said officer shall sell said property in the manner and under the circumstances and to the extent and subject to the same con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ditions which are or may be provided by ordinance for the sale of real estate in the city of Galveston charged with the payment of taxes imposed by said corporation; and said officer shall execute a deed to the purchaser at any such sale, and the provisions of this act in reference to the deed drawn by the collector for taxes shall apply to the deed provided for in this section. If suit is brought to re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="990" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="26" /><fw type="header" place="top">Special Laws of Texas.</fw>cover said assessments or any installments thereof, and to foreclose the lien thereof, then an additional amount of ten per cent of and upon the principal and interest of the amount due shall be collected.</p>
<p>Section 132d. In addition to the power to issue one million two hun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dred and forty thousand dollars of bonds as provided for in section 132c of the present charter, the said city shall have the power to issue bonds to the amount of two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) of the de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nomination of one hundred dollars or any multiple thereof, payable forty years after the date of their issue, bearing interest at a rate of not to exceed five per cent per annum, payable semi-annually, and said bonds shall be sold at not less than par, and the net proceeds thereof shall be used exclusively for the cash payment by the city of that part of the cost of permanent street improvements owing by property and railway owners and operators, imposed, levied and assessed under and in accordance with section 127 and 128 of this charter. Said bonds or the proceeds thereof shall be used and expended only for paying the property and railway owners&#8217; and operators&#8217; share of the cost of permanent street improve<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments, for which assessments are levied and imposed under and in accord<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ance with said sections 127 and 128, and whatever liens or other assets shall accrue to said city by the expenditure thereof shall also be a security for said bonds, and when said liens are satisfied and assets realized upon, the proceeds thereof shall also be for the benefit and security of said bonds; and the lien thereof shall follow and attach to any property im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />proved by a reinvestment of the proceeds of such liens and assets, which, however, shall be used only as the bonds or proceeds thereof are used, viz.: for the payment of the property and railway owners&#8217; and opera<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tors&#8217; share of the cost of such improvements, it being the intention of this act that said bond shall not only be secured by the general credit of the city of Galveston, but also by an additional security consisting of whatever liens and assets the city may have from time to time as the re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sult of such improvements, so that upon the maturity of said bonds all such liens and assets as are then outstanding shall, if required, be realized upon and applied to the satisfaction of said bond; and a fund shall be and is hereby provided to pay the interest and create a sinking fund to redeem said bonds, which fund is hereby fixed at not less than two and one-half per cent of the amount of the bonds outstanding, and an equiva<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lent amount shall be set aside annually out of the collection of assess<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments or installments thereof, and shall not be diverted or drawn upon for any other purpose, and the city treasurer shall honor no drafts on said fund except to pay the interest or to redeem said bonds, or to pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vide for the safe investment of said sinking fund in any bonds of this city or of the United States or State government. In addition to the foregoing the said city shall also have power to issue bonds to the extent of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) of the denomination of one hun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dred dollars ($100) or any multiples thereof, payable forty years after the respective dates of their issue, and bearing interest payable semi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />annually at a rate not exceeding five per cent per annum; said bonds to be sold as needed for cash at not less than par, and the proceeds thereof to be used and expended as follows: In erecting a pumping station at or near the source of the fresh water supply; for the construction of a large storage tank in connection with the fresh water supply; for the ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tension of the water mains in the city of Galveston for said fresh water<pb n="991" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="27" /><fw type="header" place="top">Special Laws of Texas.</fw>supply; all to be expended under the direction of the board of water commissioners of Galveston. In addition to the foregoing the said city shall also have power to issue bonds to the amount of two hundred thou<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sand dollars of the denomination of one hundred dollars or any multiple thereof, payable twenty years after date of their issuance, with the privilege of paying the same at any time on or after ten years from such date, and bearing interest payable semi-annually at a rate not exceeding five per cent (5%) per annum, said two hundred thousand dollars of bonds to be sold for cash at not less than par, and the proceeds thereof to be used for the payment of the present existing floating general indebted<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ness of the city. In addition to the general taxation to provide for the payment of this issue of two hundred thousand dollars of bonds, sixty<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />six and two-thirds (66&#8532;) of all collections from all back taxes past due January first, 1894, and still unpaid, shall be a special fund to be held and applied only to the payment of said two hundred thousand dollars of bonds until same are paid. In addition to the foregoing the said city shall also have the power to issue bonds to the amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) of the denomination of one hundred dollars ($100) or any multiple thereof, payable forty years after date of their issuance, and bearing interest payable semi-annually at a rate not exceeding five per cent per annum; said bonds to be sold for cash at not less than par, and the proceeds thereof to be used and expended in the erection and equip<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment of public school houses in said city under the direction and upon the requisition of its board of school trustees. A fund shall be provided from the general and municipal revenue of the city to pay the interest and create a sinking fund to redeem said bonds, which fund shall not be diverted or drawn upon for any other purpose, and the city treasurer shall honor no drafts upon said fund except to pay the interest upon or to re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />deem the bonds for which it was created. All of said bonds shall be signed by the mayor and countersigned by the city clerk, and shall be payable at such place as may be fixed by ordinance of the city council. It shall be the duty of the mayor when such bonds are issued to forward the same to the Comptroller of State, whose duty it shall be to register them in a book kept for the purpose and to endorse on each bond regis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tered his certificate of registration. The indebtedness provided for in this section shall not be limited or governed by the provisions or limita<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions contained in sections 28, 132, 132a or 132b of this charter.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. The fact that the next election of officers and aldermen of the city of Galveston takes place before the expiration of the ninety (90) days after the adjournment of this Legislature, at which time according to the Constitution this act would take effect, creates an emergency and public necessity that the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several clays be suspended and that this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>
<p>[Note.&#8212;The foregoing act was presented to the Governor of Texas for his approval on the 12th day of April, A.

<p>Section 43. To borrow money on the credit of the city and issue bonds therefor for permanent public improvements to an amount not to exceed fifty thousand dollars for and during any one year, commencing June first, 1895; and every proposition to borrow money as aforesaid shall be submitted to the qualified tax paying voters of the city, and shall dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tinctly specify the purposes for which the loan is desired and the perma<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nent public improvement to be constructed, and if said proposition be sustained by a majority of said votes cast, such loan shall be lawful. All bonds shall specify for what purpose they were issued, and when sold shall net the city not less than their par value with accrued interest to date of payment of proceeds into the city treasury; and the bonds shall be negotiated in lots as the city council may determine and direct: Pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided, that no debts shall be contracted for the payment whereof such bonds or lot thereof are issued until such bonds or lot of bonds shall have been disposed of and the proceeds thereof paid into the city treasury; and no debt shall ever be created by said city unless at the same time provision be made to assess and collect annually a sufficient sum to pay the interest thereon and create a sinking fund of at least two per cent thereon; which fund shall not be diverted or drawn for any other pur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pose; and the city treasurer shall honor no draft drawn on said fund ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cept to pay the interest, or to redeem the bonds for which it was provided: Provided, the rate of tax shall not exceed one-half of one per cent, and the rate of interest paid shall not exceed six per cent: Provided, also, no loan shall be made for any other purpose or purposes than those con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nected with the corporation of said city; and no loan shall be made to aid any private enterprise, railroad, or undertaking not under the man<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />agement or control of the city council: Provided, further, that the sink<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing fund for the redemption of any loan or debt shall be invested, as fast as the same accumulates, in United States interest bearing bonds, bonds of the State of Texas, or in bonds of said city, and the interest of such bonds shall be reinvested, and such bonds shall be sold when necessary to pay the interest or principal of the bonds issued under the provisions of this section.</p>
<p>Section 203. Whenever in the opinion of the city council it shall be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />come necessary or proper to appropriate private property for the use of the city for streets, alleys, avenues, boulevards, parks, public squares, plazas, sewers, gas works, water works, market houses, school houses, or other public purposes authorized by law, such property may be condemned for such use in the following manner: The city council shall declare by ordinance the necessity or propriety of such appropriation, describing the property sought to be appropriated, and stating the name and residence of the owner, if known, and if unknown, stating that fact, and shall file or cause to be filed with the city clerk a plat of the property proposed to be condemned. The damages to accrue to the owner of such property by reason of such condemnation shall be assessed by three commissioners, who shall be disinterested freeholders of the city, one to be selected by the owner of the property, one to be selected by the mayor, and the third to be selected by the two thus appointed. The city clerk shall issue to such owner a notice calling upon him to appoint the commissioner to be selected by him, and such notice shall be accompanied by a copy of such ordinance and a copy of this section of the charter, which notice and copies shall be delivered to such owner by the city marshal. If such<pb n="1038" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="74" /><fw type="header" place="top">Special Laws of Texas.</fw>owner shall fail to appoint the commissioner to be selected by him, giving the name of such appointee to the city clerk within ten days after the service of such notice and copies upon him, the mayor shall appoint such commissioner. If the two commissioners so appointed can not agree upon the selection of the third, then the county judge of Bexar county shall, upon application of the mayor, appoint such commissioner. Such com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioners, or any two of them, after being duly sworn to perform the duties of their appointment with fidelity and impartiality, shall fix a time and place for the hearing of the parties upon the matter of such assessment, and shall give not less than ten clays notice to both parties of such time and place, which notice may be served by any disinterested person capable of making oath to his return, who, shall make his return under oath. When the property sought to be condemned is the property of the estate of a deceased person or of a minor, or a person of unsound mind, and such estate has a legal representative, or such minor or person of unsound mind has a guardian, the notice and copies hereinbefore pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided for shall be served upon such legal representative or guardian, who shall make the appointment hereinbefore required to be made by the owner and within the time hereinbefore prescribed; otherwise the same shall be made by the mayor. When the property sought to be condemned is the property of a non-resident of this State, such owner shall have twenty days after service of notice and copies in which to appoint the commissioner to be selected by him, and twenty days&#8217; notice of the hear<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing before the commissioners after service of notice thereof. At the time and place appointed for such hearing, or at any other time and place to which the hearing may be adjourned, the said commissioners or any two of them shall proceed to hear evidence and assess the damages to accrue to the owner of the property by reason of its condemnation. For such purpose the said commissioners shall have power to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of testimony and to admin<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ister oaths and punish for contempt as fully and in the same manner as is provided by law for the district and county courts. A report of such assessment, signed by the commissioners making the same, shall be filed by them with the city clerk. The city council shall by ordinance accept or reject such report. If such report be accepted by the city council, the damages so assessed shall be paid to the owner of the property or his legal representative or guardian, as the case may be, or deposited with the city treasurer, subject to the order of such owner, legal representa<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tive or guardian, after which such property may at any time be taken for the use of the city. If the report be rejected by the city council, proceedings may be taken anew to assess the damages. If no report be made within thirty days after the appointment of the commissioners, proceedings may be taken anew to assess the damages.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. That the following sections be and the same are hereby added to the said act of incorporation, and all acts amendatory thereof:</p>
<p>Section 203a. The method of condemning private property for the use of the city, prescribed in section 203 of its charter, as amended by this act, shall not be exclusive; and private property may also be con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />demned for the uses of the city for the purposes expressed in said section, by the same proceedings and under the same rules, so far as applicable, as are now provided by the general laws of this State for the condemna<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion of private property for the use of railroad corporations, or in any<pb n="1039" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="75" /><fw type="header" place="top">Special Laws of Texas.</fw>other manner or by any other proceedings authorized by the general law of this State for the condemnation of private property for public use.</p>
<p>Section 203b. Said city is hereby authorized to acquire by purchase, gift, devise or condemnation, any private property or any interest therein, whether such property be situated within or without the cor<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />poration limits of said city, which may be necessary or proper for the establishment and maintenance of an efficient system of sewers for said city.

<p>Sec. 3. The near approach of the close of the present session of the Legislature, and the importance of the immediate operation of the pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />visions of this act create an imperative public necessity for the suspen<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sion of the constitutional rule requiring all bills to be read on three several days; and said rule is hereby suspended, and this act shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage.</p>

<p>Section 35b. The assessor and collector shall assess all property which for any cause has not been rendered, placing such valuation thereon as he may deem just. If the owners of such property are un<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />known such assessment shall be in the name &#8220;unknown.&#8221;</p>
<p>Section 101a. A lien is hereby created on all property, personal and real, in favor of the city of Port Worth for all taxes, ad valorem, occu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pation or otherwise.

<p>Section 103a. The personal property of all persons owing any taxes to the city of Fort Worth is hereby made liable for all of said&#8221; taxes, whether the same be due on personal or real property, or upon both: Provided, however, that this section shall not apply to any personal property which is now exempt from forced sale under the laws of the State of Texas.</p>
<p>Section 104a. In addition to the foregoing powers granted to the city of Fort Worth for the collection of taxes, it is hereby authorized and empowered to institute snit in any court of competent jurisdiction against any delinquent tax payer to foreclose a lien in favor of said city upon any real estate or personal property owned by such delin<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quent, and upon the recovery of judgment to have the same sold to satisfy such tax, and the purchaser at such sale shall receive a good and absolute title. Such suit shall be brought in the name of the city of Fort Worth as plaintiff; and it shall not be necessary to bring a separate suit against such delinquent tax payer, but any number of such delinquents may be joined as defendants in one suit, and a foreclosure decreed against each, and the costs of suit shall be in proportion to the amount of taxes of such delinquents so joined. Should any delinquent taxpayer against whom suit is insti<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tuted be a non-resident of the State, the clerk of the court where said suit is pending shall, upon application of the plaintiff or his attor<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="1046" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="82" /><fw type="header" place="top">Special Laws of Texas.</fw>ney, issue a notice to such defendant, as required by article 1230, Re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vised Statutes of the State of Texas, except that such notice shall not he accompanied by a certified copy of plaintiff&#8217;s petition. Should the city attorney or assessor and collector make affidavit before the clerk of the court wherein such suit is pending that the residence of any defendant is unknown to the affiant, or that he is a transient person, or that he is a non-resident, then such defendant shall be cited by publication as pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided in article 1235, Revised Statutes of the State of Texas: Pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided, that in sale for the satisfaction of such delinquent taxes only suf<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ficient amount of the property shall be sold to satisfy the unpaid taxes; and persons whose property shall be sold shall have two years in which to redeem the same by paying double the amount of such taxes and costs and all costs of suits.</p>
<p>Section 104b. The city of Port Worth is hereby authorized and em<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />powered to institute suit in any court of competent jurisdiction to col<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lect any back taxes against, any delinquent taxpayer and to foreclose the lien for such taxes, and upon recovery of judgment to have the property against which such tax was levied and assessed sold to satisfy the same, and the purchaser at such sale shall receive a good and absolute title to such property. Such suits shall be brought and service had in the man<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ner prescribed in the foregoing section: Provided, that in sales for the satisfaction of such delinquent taxes only a sufficient amount of prop<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />erty shall be sold to satisfy the unpaid taxes: Provided, further, that any person whose property is so sold shall have two years in which to redeem the same by paying double the amount of such taxes and costs and his proportion of all costs of suit.</p>

<p>Sec. 3. Whereas, it is of great importance that the city of Fort Worth shall have the power to secure better government of said city, an emer<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gency exists requiring the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days be suspended, and that this bill be placed upon its third reading and final passage, therefore an emergency and a great public necesity exists that this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>

<p>Section 1. Whereas, heretofore, to-wit: on the 11th day of January, 1890, judgments were rendered by the district court of Harris county, Texas, in two causes pending in said court, one numbered 13210 en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />titled State of Texas vs. Unknown Heirs of Philo C.

<p>Whereas, the net proceeds of sale, to-wit, the sum of one thousand and sixty-sis dollars and forty-five cents remaining after the payment of the costs of said escheat proceedings was by the sheriff of said Harris county paid into the Treasury of the State, which said net proceeds of said sale are still in the Treasury of the State; and whereas, said escheat proceedings have been by the courts of the State declared and adjudged to be void in suits brought against said Caplen by said Caroline M. Peck and parties claiming under said Philo C.
