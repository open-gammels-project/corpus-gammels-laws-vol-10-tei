<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That Sections 4 and 18 and 19 of the above entitled act be, and the same are hereby amended so as to read as follows:</p>
<p>Sec. 4. The municipal government of the city shall consist of a city council composed of the mayor and two aldermen from each ward, a majority of whom shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of busi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ness, except at call meetings for the imposition of taxes, when two<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />thirds of a full board shall be required unless herein otherwise specified. The other officers of the corporation shall be an assessor and collector of taxes, a secretary, a city attorney, a marshal, a city engineer, and such other officers and agents as the city council may from time to time di<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />rect; provided, that the offices of assessor and collector, city attorney, and city engineer may be dispensed with by an ordinance of the city council, and the powers and duties herein prescribed for such officers may be conferred by said council upon other officers; and provided fur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ther, the custodian of the funds of the city shall be any person selected by vote of the majority of the city council to act in such capacity, and to be known as &#8220;City Treasurer.&#8221; Such treasurer shall act by virtue of his appointment for a term of two years, and until a successor is ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pointed, unless removed by vote of two-thirds of the city council, for reasons deemed by said city council to be good and sufficient, which reasons shall be spread at length upon the minutes of said city council. Said city treasurer shall be required to take an oath of office, and it shall be the duty of the city council to award the custody of the funds of the city to the highest and best bidder for such privilege, they being the judges of what is highest and best.</p>
<p>The above named officers (except the city treasurer, who shall not be considered within the meaning of this act an officer), shall be elected by the qualified electors of said city as hereinafter provided, and shall hold their offices for two years and until the election and qualification of their successors; provided, also, that at the first election for aldermen in any new ward defined by the city council, there shall be two aldermen elected; the one receiving the highest number of votes shall hold for two years, and the one receiving the next highest number of votes shall hold for one year, and thereafter one alderman shall be elected at each annual election for two years, as in the wards now existing in said city, and at each annual election hereafter there shall be elected one alder<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />man from each ward in said city as at present, who shall hold for two years.</p>
<p>Sec. 18. The city treasurer shall give bond in favor of the city with<pb n="1350" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="8" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>sufficient security to be approved by the city council, in any amount re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quired by the city council, such bond in any event to be not less than seventy-five thousand ($75,000) dollars, and to be conditioned for the faithful discharge of the duties of city treasurer.</p>
<p>The city treasurer shall receive and securely keep all moneys belong<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing to the city, and shall make all payments for the same, upon the order of the mayor attested by the secretary under the seal of the corporation; provided, that no order shall be paid unless the said order shall show upon its face that the city council has directed its issuance and show for what purpose it was issued.</p>
<p>The said city treasurer shall render to the city council a full and cor<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />rect statement of the receipts and disbursements of the money of said city, showing the status of each fund, at the first regular meeting of the city council for each quarter, and whensoever at other times the said city council may require such statement. At the end of every half year the city treasurer shall cause to be published at the expense of the city a statement showing the amount of receipts and expenditures for the six months next preceding, and the general condition of the city finances. The city treasurer shall also do and perform such other acts and duties as the city council may require, and shall receive no compensation.</p>
<p>Sec. 19. The assessor and collector shall make up the assessment of all property taxed by the city, and make duplicate rolls thereof, and on completion of the rolls shall deliver one of them to the city secretary. He shall collect all taxes due the city, and in the event of non-payment of any taxes, shall proceed to sell property to raise the amount of taxes so due, and shall in the performance of his duties observe the provisions of this act and the ordinances of the city relating thereto. He shall give bond in such amount and in such form as the city council may prescribe, with good and sufficient sureties, and the city council may re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quire a new bond whenever in their opinion the existing bond is in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sufficient, and whenever such bond is required he shall perform no official act until said bond shall be given and approved. He shall, at the ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />piration of every week, pay to the city treasurer all money by him col<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lected, and shall report to the city council at the first meeting in every month all money so collected and paid; and he shall perform all such other duties and in such manner and according to such rules and regula<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions as the city council may prescribe.

<p>Sec. 161. The city council [shall] have the power to appropriate pri<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vate property for public purposes. Whenever the city council of said city shall deem it necessary to take any private property, either within or without the city limits, for any of the following purposes, to wit: In order to open, extend, change or widen any public street, avenue or alley, or for the construction of water mains or sewers, either within or without the city limits, or for the improvement and enlargement of its water works, including riparian rights, water sheds, reservoirs, etc., public schools, parks, squares, and pleasure grounds, public wharves and land<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing places for steamers and other crafts, or for the straightening or im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />proving the channel of any stream, branch or drain, such property may be taken for such purposes by making just compensation to the owner thereof.

<p>The tax levied by the city is hereby declared to be a lien, charge and encumbrance on the property on which the tax is due, which lien, charge and encumbrance the city is entitled to enforce and foreclose in any court having jurisdiction of the same, and the lien, charge and encumbrance on the property in favor of the city for the amount of taxes due on such property is such as to give the State courts jurisdiction to enforce and foreclose said lien on the property on which the tax is due; not only as against any resident of this State, but against persons who are non<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />residents of this State, or whose residence is unknown, and against the unknown heirs of any persons who own the property on which the tax is due.</p>
<p>The city of Houston has a right to maintain a suit to recover a per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sonal judgment for the amount of the tax due it, and the tax may be col<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lected by sale of the particular property on which it is assessed by en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />forcing the lien, or by the sale of that or other property under a judg<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment of the court, or by seizure and sale of personal property.</p>

Said roll shall be called the &#8220;delinquent roll,&#8221; and shall consist of so much of said roll as will identify the property and show the amount of tax due on the same.

<p>That the following property shall be exempt from taxation, to-wit: All lands used exclusively for graveyards, or grounds for burying the dead, except such as are held by any person, company or corporation with a view to profit, or for the purpose of speculation in the sale thereof; all buildings belonging to institutions of purely public charity, together with the lands belonging to and occupied by such institutions not leased or otherwise used with a view to profit, and all moneys and credits appro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />priated solely to sustaining such institutions, together with such other property as is exempt from taxation by the laws of the State of Texas.</p>
<p>That the city council by a vote taken by yeas and nays and entered upon the journal, shall hare power to assess, license and tax hawkers, peddlers, auctioneers, theatrical and other exhibitions, shows and amuse<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments, billiard tables, nine and ten pin alleys, alleys with any number of pins, public drays, wagons, omnibuses and carriages, grog shops, tippling houses and dram shops, beer saloons (whether for the sale of domestic beer or otherwise), and such other trades or occupations not especially mentioned herein as may be taxed by the laws of the State; but no assess<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="1419" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="77" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>ment or license tax levied under this section shall exceed one-half the amount levied by the State for the same period on such profession or occupation, and the same may be regulated, levied and collected in the same manner as said taxes are regulated and collected by the State.</p>
<p>That the license tax shall be collected by the assessor and collector of taxes, and shall be paid to that officer in current funds of the United States by each and every person or firm owing such license and before engaging in any trade, profession, business, calling, avocation or occu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pation subject to such tax, taking his receipt therefor, which receipt shall be esteemed lawful license for the pursuit of the occupation indi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cated. And if any person shall engage in any business, calling, avocation or occupation which by an ordinance of said city is subject to a license tax, without first having obtained such license, he, she or they shall be liable to arrest and imprisonment and a fine of ten dollars ($10) for each and every day such violation of said ordinance may continue; and this section shall apply to all persons owing license and failing to pay the same, and the city council may make such further regulations as it deems necessary to enforce this provision and punish the violation thereof.</p>
<p>The city council may by resolution provide for the pay and may allow interest upon advance payment of taxes at a rate not to exceed six per cent per annum for the time intervening between the time of such pay<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment and the time when such taxes would be due and payable; provided, that no such resolution shall be passed, nor such interest allowed, ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cept for the purpose of raising money to meet the current expenses of the city for legitimate purposes. Such resolution shall state the amount of money sought to be raised by this means, and when said amount has been received the assessor and collector shall immediately notify the mayor and city council that the amount called for in the resolution has been received, and the city council shall not pay interest on moneys subse<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quently paid in for taxes of that year. In receiving moneys for taxes in advance, under the resolution provided for herein, the assessor and col<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lector shall allow the tax payer to retain out of such payment the amount of interest allowed thereon, and shall give his receipt for the whole amount showing what sum is actually paid in, and what sum is allowed as interest on such payment.</p>
<p>A board or appraisement composed or two aldermen and one citizen shall be annually nominated by the mayor and confirmed by the council, and it shall be their duty as soon as possible after the completion of any one of the assessment rolls by the assessor and collector of taxes to meet and carefully examine said roll, and properly and equitably adjust the taxable values thereon, thus continuing until they have examined and ad<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />justed and equalized the taxes assessed on all the rolls under regulations to be fixed by the city council, when they, together with the assessor and collector of taxes shall make due report of their action to the city coun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cil. The members of said board shall receive such compensation for their services while engaged upon said rolls as the council may determine, not to exceed five dollars per day, and all matters pertaining to taxation shall be referred to such board, from whose final decision there shall be no appeal; provided further, that the board of appraisement shall not re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />main in session over sixty days.</p>
<p>Sec. 41. The city council shall have the power and authority to issue during the year 1897, bonds to the amount of two hundred and fifty<pb n="1420" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="78" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>thousand dollars, which shall be sold for not less than par, the proceeds of the sale of which shall be devoted to the paving of streets, and sewers, and the city council shall also have the power and authority to issue bonds for the purpose of funding bonds of the city of a previous issue and may also, by a vote of two-thirds of all the aldermen elected, borrow money on the credit of the city for permanent improvements to an amount not to exceed one hundred thousand dollars in any one year, and may issue bonds of the city therefor. No additional bonds shall be issued for any purpose without submission to a vote of the tax payers of said city.</p>
<p>To create a debt during any one year exceeding one hundred thousand dollars exclusive of refunding bonds and of bonds for the purpose of paving streets and constructing sewers provided to be issued for the year 1897, as above authorized, the question must be submitted to the tax paying voters of the city, and if a majority of the votes polled shall be in favor of creating such debt, it shall be lawful for the city council to authorize the issuance of bonds for the amount named in the resolu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion named in the ordinance or resolution submitting the question to the voters.</p>
<p>No bonds shall be issued drawing more than six per cent per annum interest, and they shall be invalid if sold for less than par; and all bonds shall express upon their face the purpose for which they are issued.</p>
<p>The ordinance authorizing any bonds to be issued shall provide a fund to pay the interest, and create a sinking fund sufficient to pay the bonds at maturity, and said sinking fund shall be invested in bonds of the State of Texas, of counties in the State of Texas, or in bonds of the United States, or may be used for the purchase of bonds of the city which are not yet due, and neither interest nor sinking fund shall be devoted to any other purpose whatever.</p>
<p>Sec. 42. That this act shall be deemd a public act, and judicial notice shall be taken thereof in all courts. No genral law hereafter passed by the Legislature of the State shall be held to repeal any power herein granted, or which is now vested in the corporation of Houston, unless the act conferring such power be specially referred to in such repealing act.</p>
<p>Sec. 43. The city council may, whenever it deems it to the best inter<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />est of the city, pass an ordinance fixing salaries for all officers and em<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ployes, and provide by ordinance that all fees and commissions shall be paid into the treasury of the city; provided further, that this ordinance, in the event of its passage, shall not become effective until the next city election.</p>
<p>Sec. 44. Whereas, there are no adequate laws in force providing for the paving, improving and repairing of the streets and sidewalks of the city of Houston, there exists an imperative public necessity for suspend<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days, and an emergency exists, which requires this act to take effect from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>
