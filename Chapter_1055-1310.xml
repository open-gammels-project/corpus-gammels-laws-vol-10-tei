<p>Article 386c. That all cities and towns in this State whose corpora<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion may be defective by reason of the failure of such cities and towns to restrict their territorial limits within the time and in the manner re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quired by law, but which have in fact restricted their limits and have re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="1061" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="7" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>corded the lines of such restricted limits in the minute book of such city and town and in the record book of deeds in the county in which such city or town is situated, and the boundaries of which as now recognized by the ordinances of such cities or towns and as fixed by the lines so re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />corded do not include more territory than provided for in article 386a, be and such incorporations are hereby in all things validated, the same as if such territorial limits had been duly fixed and restricted within the time and in the manner required by law.</p>

<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That Chapter 1, Title 29, of the Revised Civil Statutes of the State of Texas, adopted at the regular session of the Twenty-fourth Legislature, be amended by adding to said chapter, two articles, immediately after Article 1132a, and numbered 1132b and 1132c, as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1132b. Should any county judge fail to appear at the time appointed for holding the court, or should he during the term be absent, or unable or unwilling to hold the court, a special county judge may be elected in the same manner as is provided for the election of a special judge of the Dictrict Court, in Articles 1071 to 1074 inclusive, so far as applicable, and the special county judge so elected shall have all the power and authority of the county judge while in the trial and disposi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="1062" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="8" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>tion of all the cases pending in said court during the absence, inability, or such refusal of the county judge elected. And similar elections may be held from time to time during the term to supply the absence, failure or inability of the county judge, or any special judge to perform the duties of the office.</p>
<p>Article 1132c. When a special county judge shall have been so elect<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ed, it shall be the duty of the clerk to enter upon the minutes of the court, a record such as is provided for the District Court in Article 1075, and such record shall have the same force and effect provided for the rec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ord of the District Court in similar cases in article 1076.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. The fact that there is now no law in this State providing for the election or appointment of a special county judge to act in case of the sickness or other inability of the county judge to hold or carry on the terms of the County Court, causes great inconvenience and delays in the administration of justice, creates an emergency and an imperative public necessity that the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days should be suspended, and an emergency exists that this act take effect from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>

<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That each member of the Commissioners&#8217; Court of Travis County shall be ex officio road commissioner of their respective districts, and under the direction of the Commissioners&#8217; Court, shall have charge of all the teams, tools and machinery belonging to the county, and placed in their hands by the said court, and it shall be their duty, under such rules and regulations as the Commissioners&#8217; Court may prescribe, to superin<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tend the laying out of new roads, the making or changing of roads, and the building of bridges.</p>
<p>Each of said commissioners shall, before entering upon the duties of their office, execute a bond of one thousand dollars, with two or more good and sufficient sureties, payable to the county judge of said county, for the use and benefit of the road and bridge fund, conditioned that they will perform all the duties required of them by law or by the Com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioners&#8217; Court, and that they will account for all money or property belonging to the county that may come into their possession.</p>

<p>Each of said commissioners shall receive as salary for the services re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quired of them by this act three hundred dollars per annum, payable quarterly, or as the Commissioners&#8217; Court may determine.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. Subject to the orders and control of the Commissioners&#8217; Court, the road commissioners shall have charge of all such teams, wagons, tools and machinery as the Commissioners&#8217; Court shall place in their custody for use on the public roads of said county, and shall exe<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cute and deliver to the county clerk of said county his receipt therefor, specifying each item and its value, which shall be filed by the clerk of the county court in his office, and a certified copy thereof shall be ad<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />njissible in evidence in any suit against said commissioner and his sure<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ties or either of them, on his said bond for the property or the value thereof, the same as the original would be.</p>
<p>Said road commissioner and his sureties shall be responsible on his bond for all such property thus turned over to him until he shall account therefor.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. The road commissioners shall have control of all road over<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />seers in the county, and shall deliver to each all teams, tools, wagons and machinery necessary in working the roads in the district of such overseers so far as he has been supplied therewith by the Commissioners&#8217; Court, taking the receipt of said road overseer therefor, specifying each item and giving its value, which receipt shall be a full answer to the lia<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />bilities of the road commissioner for all such teams, wagons, tools and machinery. It shall be the duty of the road overseer, when he has fin<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ished the work on his road, to return to said road commissioner all teams, wagons, tools and machinery received from him, and to take up the re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceipt given for the same.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. Each road commissioner and overseer shall, as to all teams, wagons, tools and machinery delivered to him by the Commissioners&#8217; Court or road commissioner, be deemed and held to be the bailee of the county, and shall be responsible to the county for the value thereof until accounted for by him.</p>
<p>It shall be sufficient to exempt the road commissioners or any road overseer from liabilities for any property received by him as herein pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided to show that he has delivered the same to any person authorized by law or by the orders of the Commissioners&#8217; Court of the county to receive the same, or that the same has died, been lost or destroyed with<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />out negligence or fault on his part.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. It shall be the duty of the road commissioners of the county, so far as practicable and as soon as possible, to inform themselves of the condition of the public roads of their respective precincts, and under such rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the Commissioners&#8217; Court of said county, said road commissioners shall determine what character of work shall be done upon the different roads of their pre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cincts, and when and wherever needed, they shall establish the grade of such roads and direct the manner of draining the same, which direc<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions shall be obeyed and observed by all road overseers unless changed by order of the Commissioners&#8217; Court.</p>

<p>Each road overseer shall have control of all hands within his road district and subject to road duty, and shall see that each such road hand shall perform his duty in working said roads and that each hand when called out shall perform a fair day&#8217;s work, and if any hand so called out shall refuse to work in a proper manner, or to do his part of any service assigned him, such road overseer shall treat him as if he had failed to appear in obedience to the summons, and such hand shall be liable to the same penalties as if he had failed to appear in obedience to the sum<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mons.</p>
<p>The Commissioners Court may allow to each road overseer who shall be engaged in the discharge of his duty for more than five days during any one year, a compensation not to exceed $1.50 per day for the time so served over and above five days, and in addition thereto said court may enter an order exempting such road overseer from duty in said county for the next succeeding year, if his services, in the opinion of the court, have been of a kind to merit such exemption.</p>
<p>Sec. 7. The Commissioners&#8217; Court of said county shall have full power and authority to adopt such system for working, laying out, and repairing the public roads in such county as to said court may seem best; and from time to time said court may change its plans or system of work in such manner as it may deem advisable. The said Commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioners&#8217; Court shall have the power to purchase such teams, wagons, tools and machinery as may be necessary for the working of its public roads, and also all material that may be needed therefor; all of which shall be paid out of the road and bridge fund of said county. The Commissioners&#8217; Court of the county may, in its discretion, work the county convicts of said county upon the public roads, and shall pay the officers one-half of the costs so worked out by them.</p>
<p>As a reward for faithful services and good behavior while engaged in any work upon the public roads, the said Commissioners&#8217; Court shall have the authority to grant a reasonable commutation of time for which any convict would be compelled to work in order to pay his fine and costs, and such court shall make proper rules and regulations to govern and control in the granting of such commutations.</p>
<p>The said Commissioners&#8217; Court shall have authority to employ such labor as may be necessary to work the public roads of the county, to be paid for out of the road and bridge fund, and such labor shall be under the control of the road commissioners or such other persons as said court may employ and direct.</p>
<p>Sec. 8. Every owner of a farm or other lands upon which a hedge of any description grows on or near the line of a public road shall be re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quired to keep the same trimmed so that the height of the same shall not exceed fixe feet above the level of the ground, and any such owner who shall fail or neglect to so trim such hedge shall be notified in writ<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing by the road overseer of that district to trim such hedge as herein required; and in case such owner shall, after receiving such notice, fail or refuse to so trim such hedge within a reasonable time, he shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction, shall be fined in any sum not to exceed twenty dollars per week from and after the time<pb n="1077" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="23" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>that he received said notice, such fine to be paid into the county treas<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ury and to be placed to the credit of the road and bridge fund of said county.</p>
<p>If any owner of any farm shall fail or refuse, after being notified as herein required, to trim his hedge, as required by this act, then the road overseer shall cause the same to be trimmed in accordance with the provisions of this act, to be paid for out of the road and bridge fund of the county.</p>
<p>Sec. 9. The Commissioners&#8217; Court of said county may make contracts for all supplies and materials to be used in feeding the hands and teams employed on the public roads and in the work of the same, and may make rules and regulations by which the same, and all contracts, shall be paid by the county, and all persons employed by said court shall be governed by such rules and regulations.</p>
<p>The said court may from time to time make all necessary rules and regulations for the government of the road commissioners, and all per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sons employed by said county on the public roads, which rules and regu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lations shall be entered upon the minutes of the court and a certified copy to be delivered to each person to be governed thereby.</p>
<p>Said court may require of the road commissioners to make reports at such times and in such manner as may be prescribed by the said court, and any road commissioner refusing to make such reports shall be re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />moved, and shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon convic<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion shall be fined in any sum not to exceed one hundred dollars.</p>
<p>Sec. 10. Whenever it shall be necessary to occupy any lands, for the purpose of opening, widening, straightening, or draining any road or any part thereof, if the owner of such land and the county can not agree upon the damages to be paid, the county may proceed to condemn the same in the same manner that a railroad company can condemn lands for rights of way, and the same proceedings shall be had and the same right shall exist as to each party as would exist if the proceedings were by a railroad company, except that the county shall not be required in any case to give bond.</p>
<p>Sec. 11. This act shall be taken notice of by all courts in the same manner as a general law of the State, and it shall be construed to be cumulative of all general laws of the State on the subject of roads and bridges when not in conflict therewith; but in case of such conflict this act shall control as to the county of Travis.</p>
<p>The term &#8220;roads&#8221; includes the roadbeds, ditches and drains, the bridges, and culverts, and every part of such road. The term &#8220;work and working,&#8221; as used herein, shall include the opening and laying out of new roads, widening roads, constructing and building, repairing and draining, of such roads, and everything that may be done in and about the maintenance of such road.</p>
<p>Sec. 12.

<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That Article 616a, of the Revised Statutes of the State of Texas, of 1895, be amended so that it shall hereafter read as follows:</p>
<p>Article 616a. Towns and villages authorized to incorporate under this Chapter, or having two hundred inhabitants or over, may form an incorporation for (free) school purposes only, which may include within its bounds a town or village incorporated for municipal purposes, the same not having assumed control of the public schools within its limits; provided, that the territory so incorporated for (free) school purposes shall not exceed an area of twenty-five square miles; and when so de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />siring, an election may be held under the provisions of this title and chapter, and if, at such election, a majority of the votes cast be in favor of the incorporation, it shall be the duty of the county judge to make return thereof, and cause a record of the result of such election to be made, the same as provided for by Articles 585 and 586 of this chapter; upon which entry being made, such town or village shall be regarded as duly incorporated for the purpose of establishing and maintaining free schools therein, and shall, upon notice to the State board of education by the board of trustees hereinafter provided for, receive such pro rata share of the available school fund as its scholastic population may entitle it to. And provided, also, that all school incorporations hereafter formed under the provisions of this act shall have the right to levy and collect taxes and issue bonds for school purposes, the same as school incorpora<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions heretofore formed.</p>
<p>When a town or a village is included in a corporation for (free) school purposes, and such town or village shall afterwards be incorporated for<pb n="1100" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="46" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>municipal purposes, it shall not thereby acquire a right to take the con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />trol of the schools within its limits out of the hands of the school cor<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />poration.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. Independent school districts heretofore organized which have not the required population in the town proper, but have such popula<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion in the whole independent district, shall be validated by this act.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. All laws and parts of laws, general or special, in conflict with the provisions of this act, are hereby repealed.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. The fact that several independent school districts are affected by this act, and as the time for holding elections of trustees is near at hand, creates an imperative necessity requiring the suspension of the constitutional rule providing that bills be read on three several days, and that this act take effect from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>

<p>Sec. 9.

<p>Sec. 11. Each county commissioner when acting as road commissioner shall be entitled to two dollars per day for services actually performed: Provided, that he shall not receive more than one hundred and fifty dol<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lars for any one year, said amount to be paid out of the road and bridge fund, when the account shall have been approved by the Commissioners&#8217; Court, and the court shall not approve said account unless the commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioner presenting it shall sign an oath, that the account is just, due, and unpaid, and said account shall specify the number of days work actually performed by him, and no commissioner shall be entitled to pay as road commissioner for the days that he is performing the duties of county commissioner, nor shall be be allowed pay for any other road service, except as herein provided for, neither shall be be required to inspect the roads as heretofore provided by law.</p>

<p>Sec. 13. The fact that a more efficient road law is needed, creates an emergency and imperative public necessity, that the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days be suspended, and that this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>

The survey, report, map, explanation, and estimate, herein provided for, shall be made and filed with the county clerk of the county by the surveyor as soon after his employment as may be practicable, having in view an accurate and complete report upon the physical conditions to be met in the construction of said ditch or ditches.</p>

<p>Sec. 18. The County Judge shall deliver the certificate to the County Treasurer, taking his receipt therefor, which shall be filed with the papers and archives concerning such ditch, and the County Treasurer shall col<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lect the sums due on such certificates, and deposit the amount so collected to the credit of the road and bridge fund.</p>

<p>Sec. 20. All assessments, sums, and charges, by the said viewers, or order of court, assessed against any lands or land and the owner or owners thereof, shall be a lien thereon unless prohibited by the Constitution of this State, and the same shall be collected in the manner provided in Section 19 of this act; and any damages for compensation awarded by said jury of viewers, to any land owner, on the order of the court, shall be paid out- of the county treasury on the order of said court, from the fund set aside for the construction of such ditch or ditches.</p>
<p>Sec. 21. The said jury of viewers shall each receive the sum of three dollars per day as compensation for their services for each day so actually engaged: and said surveyor and engineer shall receive as compensation, such sum as may be allowed by the Commissioned Court, provided no road overseer or any court shall on petition or otherwise have the power to change the natural course of any branch, creek, or water stream, but such volume of water shall always enter and cross said road at its natural crossing, and overseers shall always, in draining their roads, provide a culvert sufficiently broad and tall to permit said stream to flow at high<pb n="1127" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="73" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>tide, from its intersection with said road, across to its natural outflow at the opposite natural channel.</p>

<p>Sec. 23. The provisions of this act shall be cumulative to all other provisions of law, and shall not be held to repeal any existing lave upon the subject of drainage.</p>
<p>Sec. 24. Whereas, the great importance of legislation on the subject matter of this bill to large sections of the State, haying insufficient drain<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />age laws, causing great loss, creates an emergency, and the public neces<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sity demands the suspension of the constitutional rule which requires the bill to be read on three several days, therefore the rule is suspended, and this bill shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>

It shall be the duty of the county commissioner, when acting as road commissioner, to inform himself of the condition of the public roads in his district, and shall determine what character of work shall be done on said roads, and shall direct the manner of grading, draining, or otherwise improving the same, which direction shall be observed and obeyed by all road overseers of his district.</p>
<p>Sec. 6.

The Commissioners&#8217; Court may allow to any overseer who shall be engaged in the discharge of the duties of his office for more than five days during any one year, a compensation not to exceed one dolar and one half per day for the time so served.</p>
<p>Sec. 7.

At the time of making such contract, the court shall direct the county treasurer to pass the amount to a particular fund for that purpose, and the treasurer shall keep a separate account of such funds, and the same shall not be used for any other purpose, and can only be paid out on the order of said court; and the said court shall have authority to employ any hands or teams to work on the roads under such regulations and for such price as they may deem best.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. The commissioners&#8217; court of said county shall require all county convicts, not otherwise employed, to labor upon the public roads under such regulations as they may prescribe, and each convict so worked shall receive a credit of fifty cents, on his fine first, and then on the cost, for each day he may labor. The commissioners&#8217; court may provide such reasonable regulations and punishments as may be necessary to require such convicts to perform good work; and may provide a reward not to ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceed ten dollars, to be paid out of the road and bridge fund, for the re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />capture and delivery of any escaped convict, to be paid to any person, other than the guard or person in charge of such convict at the time of his escape. The commissioners&#8217; court may grant a reasonable commu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tation of time for which a convict is committed as a reward for faithful services and good behavior, in no case to exceed one-tenth of the time. Said court may provide the necessary houses, prisons, clothing, bedding, food, medicine, and medical attention, and guards for the safe and hu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mane keeping of convicts. The commissioners&#8217; court may at a regular meeting allow to the officers and witnesses such amount of their cost for the arrest and conviction of said convict, as now provided by law, which amount shall be paid out of the road and bridge fund, upon the order of said court, when said fine and costs have been worked out, as provided in this section; provided, that this act shall not be construed so as to relieve any convict from tire payment of all costs for which he would be liable under the general laws of this State. Nothing in this section shall be construed so as to deprive the commissioners&#8217; court of the right to have convicts to work a part of all of their time on the county convict farm; but authority is herein expressly given to said court to re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quire convicts to labor, in payment of fine and cost, either upon the county convict farm, or upon the public roads, or partly upon both, as to the said court it may seem best, and the provisions of this section shall apply, as far as practicable, in all cases where convicts labor upon the county convict farm.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. Each county commissioner shall have control of all road over<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />seers in his district, and shall deliver to each of them, so far as he has been supplied by the commissioners&#8217; court, all teams, tools, and machin<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ery necessary in working the roads in the district of said overseer, taking receipt of said overseer therefor, specifying each item and giving its value, which receipt shall be a full answer of the liability of the commissioner, and shall fix the liabilities of the overseer; and any commissioner or over<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="1143" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="89" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>seer who shall have been entrusted with any teams, tools or machinery belonging to said county, shall be liable for any damage that may occur to the same while in his possession caused by negligence or want of due care of same, and shall not use or permit the same to be used for private purposes without the consent of the commissioners&#8217; court. It shall be the duty of the road overseer when he has finished work on his road to return to said commissioners all teams, tools, and machinery received from them by him and take up the receipt given therefor.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. It shall be the duty of the commissioners, when acting as road commissioners, to inform themselves of the condition of the public roads in their districts, and they shall determine what character of work shall be done upon said roads, and shall direct the manner of grading, draining or otherwise improving the same, which direction shall be ob<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />served and obeyed by all overseers of his district.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. The commissioners may require each overseer in his district to call out the hands in such numbers as may be sufficient to perform the work, but no road hand shall be required to work exceeding five days in any one year, or two days with himself and team, unless the term of service as prescribed by the general laws shall be extended beyond that time; provided, that all road hands in any particular district shall, as far as practicable, be worked a uniform time. Each road overseer, or in case of his absence, any person deputized by him, shall have full control of all road hands within his road district, and shall see that each hand when called out shall perform a good day&#8217;s work; and if any hand, when so called out, shall fail or refuse to do a good day&#8217;s work, or to work in the manner the overseer may direct, he shall be liable to the same penalty as if he had failed to appear in obedience to the summons. The commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioners&#8217; court may allow any overseer who shall be engaged in the dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />charge of the duties of his office for more than five days during any one year a compensation not to exceed one dollar and fifty cents per day for the time so served.</p>
<p>Sec. 7. Any citizen of Hopkins county who is subject to road duty, who shall, on or before the first day of January of any year, pay to the county treasurer of said county, the sum of three dollars, shall be exempt from road duty for such year, beginning on the first day of January. The treasurer shall receive and receipt for all money so paid him and place the same to the credit of the road and bridge fund, to be used in the road precinct to which the hand making such payment belongs. The treas<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />urer shall, on the third day of January, or as soon thereafter as practica<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ble, furnish the commissioners&#8217; court with a list of all parties who have paid said sums as provided in this section, and said court shall imme<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />diately have overseers in district wherein said sums have been paid noti<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fied of the payment of the same, and by whom paid.</p>
<p>Sec. 8. Every person liable to work on the public roads in Hopkins county, who shall pay to his road overseer at any time before the day ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pointed to work on his road, the sum of one dollar for each day that he is summoned to work, shall be exempt from work for each day paid for.</p>
<p>Sec. 9. Each person summoned to work on the road shall take with him an axe, hoe, pick, spade, shovel, plow, scraper or such other tools as may be desired and directed by the overseer, or if he has no such tools as are desired and directed by the overseer to take with him, he shall take such<pb n="1144" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="90" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>other suitable tools as he may have; provided, the county shall be liable for, and the commissioners&#8217; court, under such regulations as they may prescribe, shall pay for all such breakage or damage to tools as may have resulted from public road work, and not caused by the negligence of the person furnishing the same. Such overseer may also summon and require such road hand to bring with him for road work such team or teams as he may have on hand suitable for road work; provided, such hand shall be allowed two and one-half days time for each day put in by a hand and his team, and one and one-half days for his team without such hand.</p>
<p>Sec. 10. If any person liable to work the public road, after being le<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gally summoned, shall intentionally fail or refuse to attend either in per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />son or by an able and competent substitute, or fail or refuse to furnish his team or tools at the time and place designated by the person summon<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing him, or to pay to the overseer such sum as one dollar per day for each day summoned to work, he shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof shall be fined in any sum not to exceed ten dollars.</p>
<p>Sec. 11. At the regular term of the commissioners&#8217; court of each year all road overseers shall make their report under oath, upon the forms to be furnished them by the said court, which said report shall be examined by said court, and all accounts for services or labor performed for over<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />work by such overseer during the past year, and of moneys had and ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pended by him, shall be audited and settled; and as soon thereafter as practicable said commissioners&#8217; court shall appoint and commission road overseers for the succeeding year. Any overseer intentionally failing to perform his duties as such overseer or failing or refusing to serve and perform the duties of overseer when appointed by said court, or to per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />form any other duty required of him by law or by the commissioners&#8217; court, or by the commissioner of his district, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction shall be fined in any sum not exceed<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing; twenty-five dollars.</p>
<p>Sec. 12. Whenever it shall be necessary to occupy any land for the opening, widening, straightening, changing or draining any road or any part thereof, if the owner of said land cannot agree with the court as to damages to be paid, the court may proceed to condemn the same, in the same manner that a railroad company can condemn land for a right of way, and the same proceedings may be had and the same right shall exist to each party that would exist if the proceedings were by a railroad com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pany, except that the county shall in no case be required to give bond.</p>
<p>Sec. 13. Each county commissioner, when acting as road commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioner, shall be entitled to two dollars per day for services actually per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />formed; provided, that he shall not receive more than ninety dollars per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quarter; said per diem to be paid out of the road and bridge fund when the account shall have been approved by the commissioners&#8217; court; and the court shall not approve said account unless the commissioner pre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />senting it shall make oath that the account is just, due, and unpaid; and said account shall specify the number of days work actually performed by him, and that it was necessary to be done under the circumstances; and no commissioner shall be entitled to pay as road commissioner, either for himself or his deputy, while performing the duties of county commissioner, nor shall be receive any additional pay than that provided<pb n="1145" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="91" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>by this section for inspecting or riding over his road, or for other road service.</p>
<p>Sec. 14. Every owner of a farm or other lands upon which a hedge of any description grows on or near the public road, shall be required to keep the same trimmed so that the same shall not obstruct said road; and any such owners who shall fail or neglect to trim such hedge shall be notified in writing by the road overseer of that district to trim such hedge as herein required, and in such case that such owner shall after receiving such notice, fail or refuse to trim such hedge within a reason<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />able time, he shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />viction shall be fined in any sum not exceeding twenty dollars per week from and after the time that he received such notice, such fine to be paid into the county treasury and to be placed to the credit of the road and bridge fund of said county. If any owner of any farm shall fail or refuse, after being notified as herein required, to trim his hedge as re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quired by this act, then the road overseer shall cause the same to be trimmed in accordance with the provisions of this act, to be paid for out of the road and bridge fund of the county.</p>
<p>Sec. 15. In all cases where the cost of material and labor exceeds two hundred dollars, it shall be the duty of said court to construct, grade, or otherwise improve any road or bridge by contract, the same to be adver<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tised for as provided by said commissioners&#8217; court.</p>
<p>Sec. 16. This act shall be taken notice of by all courts in the same manner as the general law of the State, and it shall be construed to be cumulative of all general laws of the State on the subject of roads and bridges when not in conflict therewith; but in case of conflict, this act shall control as to the county of Hopkins.</p>

<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That the superintendents of the several asylums, shall, on the first day of May of each year, and quarterly thereafter, advertise for sealed proposals for furnishing to the superintendents of their respective asylums, certain supplies as hereinafter named, for two weeks, in such daily newspapers, not exceeding three in number, in Texas, as they may select for that purpose; provided, if a daily newspaper be published at or near the town or city where either of said asylums are situated, one paper shall be select<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ed from said town or city; provided, said paper charges the same price for advertising said bids as are charged by other papers selected prior to the day of opening said bids. Such advertisements shall state the articles for which said bids shall be received; they shall also state that preference shall be given to articles manufactured within the State of Texas, and when any brands of goods are specified, it is understood that any article of equal good quality, made within this State, shall be en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />titled to the preference, prices being equal, and bids shall be made sep<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />arately as hereinafter named.</p>
<p>Sec. 2.

<p>Sec. 3. On the day for opening said bids, the board of trustees of the respective asylums, or such of them as may be present, shall open said bids, and shall award to the lowest responsible bidder, the contract or contracts for which he may have bid; provided, that the board of trust<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ees may reject any and all bids if in their judgment the interest of the State demands it.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. All bids shall be made for the term of three months, begin<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ning June first of each, year, and quarterly thereafter.</p>

<p>It is hereby made the duty of said board to immediately examine said estimates, and to approve the same, or any part thereof, as they may think necessary, and to give preference to articles manufactured or pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />duced within the State of Texas, whenever such article can be purchased with advantage to the State.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. Bids shall be made for the articles hereinafter named, sepa<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />rately, to-wit: Bids for fresh beef; bids for bacon and lard; bids for flour; bids for rice, peas, beans, grits, and hominy; bids for soap, coarse and fine salt, vinegar, starch, soda, pepper and baking powders; bids for coffee and tea; bids for white and brown sugar; bids for molasses; bids for mackerel, prunes and dried apples, kraut, brooms, candles and oil, canned goods, alcoholic stimulants and tobacco; bids for dry goods, hats, hose, shoes and undershirts; bids for coal and wood; provided, that the party to whom may be awarded the contract for wood may deliver the amount required for a year, under such regulations as the board of trust<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ees may direct.</p>
<p>Sec. 7. The superintendents of the several asylums shall give an itemized receipt for all the articles delivered by the contractors of the same, and when approved by the board of trustees the Comptroller shall draw his warrant upon the Treasurer for the amount, which amount shall be charged to the appropriate appropriations for the asylums fur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nished.</p>

Said estimates shall be itemized, stating the quantity and quality of articles needed.</p>
<p>Sec. 9. The superintendents of the several asylums, in advertising for bids, shall specify the quality of articles required.

<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That it is necessary for the public use that the State of Texas own two hundred and fifty acres of land on the site of the battle field of San Jacinto, in Harris county, Texas, in addition to what it already owns, for the use of the State for public purposes as a public park, and that the sum of ten thousand dollars, or so much thereof as may be necessary, is hereby appropriated out of any money in the State treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the purchase by agreement or condemnation by the State of Texas of any tract or tracts of land constituting and composing a part of said battle field, and enclosing the same, which may be selected by the commissioners hereinafter provided for, not exceeding two hun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dred and fifty acres, situated on the site of the said battle field, for the use of the State, as a public park; and said commissioners may purchase or condemn for the State, such portion of the site of said battle field as they may in their discretion deem proper, within the restrictions and limitations hereinafter imposed.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. That the Governor shall, upon the taking effect of this act, or as soon thereafter as practicable, appoint three commissioners, who shall enter into a bond payable to the Governor of Texas or successors in office, in the sum of ten thousand dollars, conditioned that they will well and truly discharge their duties as such commissioners, and faithfully expend said money and make due report to the Governor of their action; and who shall have the powers and duties mentioned in the sections follow<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing, and who shall serve without compensation; provided, that a ma<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />jority of said commissioners may act, and a decision of the majority shall be sufficient on all matters coming before them.</p>
<p>Sec. 3.

<p>Sec. 5. Before any purchase or condemnation of any land shall be consummated under this act, a proper and complete abstract of the title thereto shall be by said commissioners presented to the attorney general and shall be examined and approved by him, showing, in his opinion, in whom the legal title thereto is vested, and upon such approval of the title by the attorney general, then, in the event either of purchase by agreement or by condemnation, the commissioners hereby appointed shall make an application in writing, and under oath, addressed to the treasurer of the State of Texas, stating the amount of land to be ac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quired, from whom acquired, how acquired, and the price to be paid therefor, and when such application has been approved by the governor, it shall be a sufficient warrant, and the treasurer is hereby required to pay the same, and each of them so made within the provisions and limita<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions of this act, and the appropriation hereby made, and said commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioners shall then take proper conveyances or evidences of title placing the title to said land in the State of Texas and pay the owner or owners therefor.</p>

<p>Article 2313. All abstracts of land titles, or land abstract books to land in this State, compiled from the records of any county in this State prior to the year 1877, which said records were partially or wholly de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />stroyed or lost from any cause during the months of May, 1874, and<pb n="1201" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="147" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>March, 1876, shall hereafter be competent prima facie evidence of the truth of the data or memoranda therein contained and compiled prior to the year 1877, and shall be admissible in evidence in the courts of this State; provided, that the compiler of such abstracts of land titles or land title abstract books shall have made heretofore, or before offered in evi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dence, affidavit before some officer authorized at the time of making such affidavit to take acknowledgments to deeds in this State, and to the effect that said abstracts of land titles or land title abstract books were compiled by him from the records of the county prior to their destruc<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion or loss, and that they contain a true and correct statement of the matters and things to which they relate; and provided, also, that it shall be admissible to offer in evidence any testimony tending to discredit or substantiate the reliability of such abstract of land titles or land title abstract books, or tending to show the compiler thereof to have been in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />competent or unreliable, or competent and reliable; and provided, fur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ther, that a copy of such abstract shall be filed in the papers of the cause in which it is sought to be used, and notice given to the opposite party at least five days before the trial, and the same defenses may be made as if copies of the original record had been filed; provided, further, that the party offering such abstracts of land titles or land title abstract books in evidence shall himself or by his agent or attorney have made affidavit that the original instrument to which the said data or memoranda relates is not then on record; that he has made diligent search and inquiry for the same in places and from persons where and in whose possession it would most probably be found, and has been unable to find the same; that to his best knowledge and belief the same is lost or destroyed; and provided, further, that the owner of said abstracts of land titles or of land title abstract books shall have filed with the county commissioners&#8217; court his application in writing (which may be granted, or refused, in the discretion of said court, and if refused, this article shall not become of force as to said application so refused) for an order of said court admit<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ting to record in said court the contract of the said owner in writing wherein the said owner shall bind himself, his heirs and assigns, as fol<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lows: That said owner, his heirs or assigns, will, whenever requested in writing, setting forth the data required by any party to any suit interested in introducing said abstracts of land titles or land title abstract books, produce the same without charge on the day demanded for introducing in evidence, and upon the trial of any cause in this State; provided, that if said owner, his heirs or assigns, are required to produce said abstracts of land titles or land title abstract books in courts of any other county than that to the lands of which said abstracts of land titles or land title abstract books pertain, they shall be, by the party at whose instance such production is required, reasonably compensated in advance for the time and expenses of the said owner, his heirs or assigns.</p>
<p>And the said owner in said contract shall bind himself, his heirs and assigns, to answer in full damages to any party damaged by the failure or default of the said owner, his heirs or assigns, without good cause, to produce said abstracts of land titles or land title abstract books, data or memoranda, when demanded, as herein provided.</p>
<p>And said contract shall further stipulate that no charge shall ever be made by said owner, his heirs or assigns, in excess of one dollar for each instrument or remove in any title in the compilation of a complete ab<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="1202" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="148" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>stract or title to the lands in the county to which said abstracts of land titles or land title abstract books pertain, and that said owner, his heirs and assigns, will, upon request and payment of the fees therefor by any person, either make, compile, and certify, or cause to be made, compiled or certified, within a reasonable time, a complete abstract of title to any lands to which said abstracts, of land titles or land title abstract books pertain; provided, that nothing herein contained shall ever be construed to any way affect or apply to any suit or suits pending in any of the courts of this State on the twelfth day of July, 1891; provided, further, that the provisions of this article shall not apply, if it can be shown by competent evidence that any such deeds were improperly recorded.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. Whereas, the enacting at this session of the present Legisla<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ture of the legislation contemplated by this bill is imperiled by the great number of bills pending before that body, therefore an emergency exists creating an imperative public necessity justifying the suspension of the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days, and it is therefore suspended, and that this act take effect and go into force from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>

<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That the Governor and Commissioner of the General Land Office be and they are hereby authorized to contract with and appoint a competent sur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />veyor to survey and return to the General Land Office plats and field notes of one hundred thousand acres of land, to be surveyed out of any of the vacant public and unsurveyed lands of this State in the manner herein<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />after provided. They shall contract with such competent surveyor at the lowest price consistent with competency and efficiency in discharging the duties of surveyor. If they deem it necessary they may advertise for bids from surveyors. The surveyor so appointed shall enter into a good and sufficient bond in a sum of not less than double the contract price of the surveys, conditioned that he will faithfully comply with the require<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments of this act, which bond shall be payable to the governor of the State, and be approved by him.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. The Commissioner of the General Land Office shall furnish the surveyor appointed under authority of this act with sketches show<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="1203" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="149" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>ing connections with any existing and established corners from which he may begin the surveys. He shall survey the lands into sections of 640 acres and in blocks after the manner of the railway surveys now existing in this State, and shall make plats of each block and survey, numbering the blocks in numerical order, beginning with number one, and shall also number each section in each block in the same manner, beginning with number one in each block. In all cases he shall mark and establish two corners on the ground for each survey, and the lines between which, if in timber, shall be distinctly marked. Said corners shall be made with at least two bearings, if in timber, and if in prairie, by earth mounds six feet in diameter and three feet high, or with a pile of rocks not less than two feet high. He shall actually survey each section on the ground and sign the field notes, himself, of each survey separately and have his chain carriers to attest the field notes of each survey by their own signatures. The surveyor shall then certify that he actually surveyed the land em<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />braced in the field notes, on the ground, and that the field notes correctly describe the land. He shall have the field notes of each survey and plat recorded in the surveyors record of the county or counties in which the lands surveyed are situated or in the county to which such county may be attached for surveying purposes in the manner now required by law. He shall, however, first forward the field notes of all surveys made in any county to the commissioner of the land office for examination both as to correctness and as to conflicts with older valid surveys, and upon their return to the surveyor, after being approved by the commissioner, they shall be recorded as above required. After the field notes are recorded the said surveyor shall make a plat of each block of surveys according to the field notes so made by him, and return same, together with the ori<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ginal field notes, recorded, to the general land office. All the lands sur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />veyed as required by this act shall thereafter be mapped in the land office and shall be known and designated as the Branch University sur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />veys for the colored people.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. It shall be the duty of the commissioner to have the sections carefully numbered on the map in accordance with the field notes of the surveys and blocks so returned by the surveyor. The odd numbered sur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />veys shall thereafter be set apart and constitute a permanent endowment for a branch University for the colored people, and the even numbered sections shall thereafter be set apart and constitute a permanent endow<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment for the public free schools of the State. Hone of the odd numbered lands surveyed, as required by this act, shall be put on the market and disposed of by the commissioner of the land office, but shall be under the control of the Board of Regents for the University of Texas, and held by the board in trust for the benefit of the said branch University for the colored people. All the funds received by said board for leases or sale of said lands shall be held sacred for the benefits and uses herein designated. The commissioners shall not sell the even numbered sections set apart herein for the public free school fund, but may lease the same to such persons only as may lease from the board of regents the odd numbers. Whenever the board may desire to sell said lands, they may contract for its sale, and the purchaser, upon exhibiting to the commissioner of the land office such contract and depositing with him a duplicate copy of the same, the commissioner may also sell the school sections corresponding with such odd numbers on the same terms and at the same price per acre<pb n="1204" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="150" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>as that embraced in the contract; provided, it shall not be sold for less than one dollar per acre: The proceeds to be paid into the treasury of the State, as now provided by law.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. Any of the vacant and unsurveyed public domain situated in any of the counties embraced in Chapter XXXIII, approved March 11, 1881, may be surveyed for the purposes set out in this act, notwith<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />standing any reservation therein or elsewhere.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. If any sale shall be made of the school lands herein as pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided in Section 4 of this act, and any payment of principal or interest shall not be made according to the contract of sale, it shall be the duty of the commissioner of the general land office to forfeit the contract without judicial ascertainment, as now provided by law, and the contract shall contain a stipulation authorizing such forfeiture which shall be signed by the purchaser.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. The surveyor shall be paid by a warrant of the comptroller drawn on the treasurer of the State out of the general revenue upon the presentation to the comptroller of the certificate of the commissioner of the general land office certifying that the lands have been surveyed and field notes and plats have been properly returned to the land office. He shall also reimburse in the same manner the contractor for any sum of money for fees which he may have paid to the county surveyor for re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cording field notes and plats, not in excess of the fees now provided by law for such recording.</p>
<p>Sec. 7.

Whenever a vacancy occurs by resignation or otherwise in the municipal offices of any incorporated town or city in this State so that the vacancy cam not be filled under the charter of said town or city or under the laws of this State now in force, then and in that event it shall be the duty of the commissioners&#8217; court of said county in which said town or city is situated, upon a petition of not less than 20 tax pay<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing voters living in said city, to order an election to be held to fill such vacancy, giving notice of not less than ten days in the usual manner pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided for such elections; provided, where such town or city has been chartered by special act of the legislature and such town or city con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tains more than 200 and less than 5000 inhabitants and the offices of such town or city have been vacant for a period of ten years or more, such charter of said town or city shall become void and forfeited, and no election of officers in such town or city shall be had; but the inhabitants of such town or city may reincorporate under the general laws of this State relating to towns and cities in the manner as now or may hereafter be prescribed by the laws of this State.</p>

<p>Sec. 11. At the regular term of the commissioners court in February of each year, all road overseers shall make their reports under oath, up<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />on forms to be furnished them by said court, which said report shall be examined by said court, and all accounts of moneys had and expended by him shall be audited and settled; and as soon thereafter as prac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ticable, said commissioners&#8217; court shall appoint and commission road overseers for the succeeding year; and in the event of the death, refusal or inability to act on the part of any road overseer so appointed, the county commissioner of the precinct shall have authority to fill the va<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cancy, and report his action in writing to the county clerk, who shall record the same in the minutes of the commissioners&#8217; court, either in term time or in vacation.

<p>Sec. 12. Whenever it shall be necessary to occupy any land for open<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing, widening, straightening, or draining any road or part thereof, if the owner of such land and the commissioners&#8217; court can not agree upon the damage to be paid, the county may proceed to condemn the same in the manner that a railroad company may condemn land for right of way, and the same proceedings may be had and the same right shall exist to such party as would exist if the proceedings were by a railroad company, except that the county shall in no case be required to give bond; pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided, that nothing contained in this section shall be held to repeal the provisions of the general law relating to the opening of public roads by juries of view, but this section shall be cumulative thereof, and the com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioners&#8217; court of Milam county may act under such general law, or the provisions of this section, at their option in such case.</p>
<p>Sec. 13. Every owner of a farm or other land upon which a hedge of any description grows on or near the public road, shall be required to keep the same trimmed so that the same shall not obstruct said road and shall not be of greater height than eight feet, and any such owner who shall fail or neglect to trim such hedge, shall be notified in writing by the road overseer of that district to trim such hedge as herein required; and in such case if such owner shall, after receiving such notice, fail or refuse to trim such hedge within a reasonable time, he shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction shall be fined in any sum not exceed<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing twenty dollars per week from and after the time that he receives such notice, such fine to be paid into the county treasury and be placed to the credit of the road and bridge fund of said county. If any owner<pb n="1220" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="166" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>of any farm shall fail or refuse, after being notified as herein required, to trim his hedge, as required by this act, then the road overseer, upon an order from the county commissioner of his precinct, shall cause the same to be trimmed in accordance with the provisions of this act, to be paid for out of the road and bridge fund of the county.</p>
<p>Sec. 14. Each county commissioner when acting as road commissioner and performing the duties imposed upon him by law or by the commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioners&#8217; court, shall be entitled to three dollars per day for the services actually performed; provided, that he shall not draw such pay for more than thirty-five days per quarter, which amount shall be paid out of the road and bridge fund when the account shall have been approved by the commissioners&#8217; court; and the court shall not approve said account un<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />less the commissioner presenting it shall sign an oath the account is just, due and unpaid, and specifying the number of [days&#8217; work] actually performed by him, and that it was necessary to be done; and no commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioner shall be entitled to pay as road commissioner while he is per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />forming the duties of county commissioner, nor shall be receive any ad<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ditional pay than that provided by this section for inspecting or riding over his road, or for other road service.</p>
<p>Sec. 15. This act shall be taken notice of by all courts, in the same manner as the general law of the State, and it shall be construed to be cumulative of all general laws of the State on the subject of roads and bridges when not in conflict therewith, but in case of conflict this act shall control as to the county of Milam, except where otherwise provided herein.</p>
<p>Sec. 16.

(4) By substituting wagons and teams suitable and satisfactory to the road overseer as provided in Section 8 of this act.</p>
<p>Sec. 12. Every insolvent tax payer being a resident of the county who shall be indebted to the county on any unpaid county poll tax, and from whom the said poll tax can not be otherwise collected by law, shall be permitted to discharge the amount of such unpaid county poll tax, in labor upon the public roads of his precinct at the rate of one dollar per day. In order to enforce the provisions of this section the collector of taxes for the county shall be required on or before the second Monday in February of every year to furnish to the several overseers of the county the names of all the defaulting poll tax payers together with the amount of the county poll tax due and unpaid by each, for which ex officio service the collector shall be exempt from road duty; and it shall be the duty of the overseer whenever any such person shall have dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />charged his county poll tax as herein provided, to report the same to the tax collector, who shall credit the party on the tax roll, and report the same in his regular report to the Commissioners&#8217; Court; provided, that no fines and penalties shall be recovered of insolvent poll tax payers for the failure to work out their poll tax under the provisions of this act.</p>
<p>Sec. 13. Each road overseer shall make his report under oath to the Commissioners&#8217; Court every six months, giving an itemized statement of all moneys belonging to the road fund which he has received, from whom received, and for what, and what disposition he has made of the same, the condition of all roads, bridges, culverts and drains, the number and character of all mile posts and guide boards erected and where the same<pb n="1231" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="177" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>are located and such other information as the Commissioners&#8217; Court may require, and may accompany said report with such suggestions as may seem to him pertinent in regard to the public roads and the duties of that office.</p>
<p>Sec. 14. Any road overseer who shall wilfully or negligently fail or refuse to comply with any provision of this act, or to perform any law<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ful and reasonable order of the Commissioners&#8217; Court, or to discharge any duty imposed upon him by this act or by any other existing law of the State, not in conflict herewith, shall be deemed guilty of a misde<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />meanor, and on conviction thereof, in a court of competent jurisdiction, shall be punished by a fine of not less than ten nor more than one hund<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />red dollars, such fine, when collected, to go into the road and bridge fund.</p>
<p>Sec. 15. Whenever it shall be necessary to occupy any private lands for the purpose of opening, widening, straightening, or draining any public road or any part thereof, if the owner of such land and the Com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioners&#8217; Court can not agree upon the amount of damage to be paid, the court may proceed to condemn the same in the same manner that a railroad company can condemn land for a right of way, and the same proceedings may be had, and the same rights shall exist to each party as would exist if the proceedings were by a railroad company; except that the county shall in no case be required to give bond either for cost or on appeal.</p>
<p>Sec. 16. This act shall be cumulative of all general laws of the State on the subject of roads and bridges and employment of county convicts not in conflict herewith and not otherwise provided herein, such general laws shall apply, but in case of conflict with general laws this act shall govern, and the courts of the State shall take judicial cognizance of this act in the same manner and to the same extent as they are required to know and notice the general laws of the State.</p>
<p>Sec. 17. The fact that there is no efficient road law in force in this State, creates an imperative public necessity that the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days be suspended, and that this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>

For the purpose of determining the existence of scab, under the provisions of this act, and to serve notice on persons as provided in Section 2, the justice of the peace having jurisdiction, upon complaint of any person owning or having charge of sheep, supported by affidavit, as to his belief that a flock of sheep within such jurisdiction are infected with scab, shall forthwith issue order to a constable or some peace officer of his county, directing such officer to summon to his aid two persons having knowledge of scab, and to proceed with such persons and exam<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ine the sheep so designated, and to notify in writing the owner or person in charge of said sheep, of the result of such examination, and to return to the court of issue such order, showing how he has executed the same.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. Any person refusing to permit the examination provided for in Section 3 of this act or to place the sheep in pens for such purpose, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof, punished by a fine of not less than one hundred nor more than two hun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dred dollars.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. Upon return of the order provided for in Section 3 of this act, the Justice of the Peace shall, if it states said sheep are not infected, or that they have been dipped, within ten days nest preceding such ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />amination, dismiss such cause. But if such order states said sheep are infected with scab and have not been dipped within the ten preceding days, said Justice of the Peace shall issue warrant of arrest forthwith, against the owner or person having said sheep in charge, and proceed as in other misdemeanor cases; provided, should defendant show, by com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />petent testimony, that such infected sheep were held only on his own<pb n="1234" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="180" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>or accustomed range, and that he had dipped all flocks so infected, as provided in this act, within twenty days after receiving notice, or within ten days next preceding the serving of such notice, he shall upon pay<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment of all accrued costs be discharged.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. The constable or other peace officer and the person summon<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ed to assist, shall receive as compensation for services performed under the provisions of this act, and for attendance at court as witnesses in such cases, the sum of two dollars and fifty cents per clay for each day actually and necessarily so engaged, and such fees shall be taxed as costs against the owner of such sheep; and execution shall be issued; provided, in all cases where it is found such sheep are not infected or have been dipped within the ten days next preceding the examination so made, the costs and fees shall be taxed against the person who made the complaint, and execution shall so issue.</p>
<p>Sec. 7. All laws and parts of laws in conflict with the provisions of this act be and the same are hereby repealed.</p>
<p>Sec. 8. The fact that there is now no adequate law upon this subject creates an emergency and an imperative public necessity requiring the suspension of the constitutional rule that requires bills to be read on three several days, and said rule is hereby suspended, and this act shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage.</p>

<p>Article 4218e. The commissioner of the general land office may, from time to time, as the public interest may require, classify any or all of the lands belonging to the several funds mentioned in this chapter that have not been heretofore classified, upon such facts as may be satisfactory to him, designating the same as agricultural, grazing or timbered land, ac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cording to the fact in the particular case; and he may prescribe such reg<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ulations in relation thereto as he may deem necessary to secure a correct classification. He may also reclassify any lands heretofore erroneously classified, upon the official certificate of the commissioners&#8217; court of the county in which said land is situated, or of the county to which such county is attached for judicial purposes, certifying what the proper classification should be, said certificate to be signed by the entire com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioners&#8217; court, including the county judge, or upon such other evi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dence as may be satisfactory to the commissioner.</p>
<p>Article 4218f. When any portion of said land has been classified to the satisfaction of the commissioner of the general land office, under the pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />visions of this chapter or former laws, such lands shall be subject to sale, but to actual settlers only, except where otherwise provided by law, and in quantities of not less than eighty acres or multiples thereof, nor more than four sections containing six hundred and forty acres, more or less; provided, that the purchaser shall not include in his purchase more than two sections of agricultural land; and provided, that where there is a fraction less than eighty acres of any section left unsold, such fraction may be sold. Any bona fide purchaser who has heretofore purchased or who may hereafter purchase any lands as provided herein shall have the right to purchase other lands in addition thereto; provided, that the total of his purchases shall not exceed four sections, and that it shall not include more than two sections of agricultural land, upon his making oath that he is not acting in collusion with others for the purpose of buy<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing the land for any other person or corporation, and that no other person or corporation is interested in the purchase thereof. And if he or his ven<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="1239" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="185" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>dor has already resided upon his home section for three years, or when he or his vendor, or both together, shall have resided upon it for three years, the additional lands purchased may be patented at any time. In all cases where a settler purchases more than one section the lands in ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cess of one section so purchased must be situated within a radius of five miles of the land occupied by him. Where any of the lands referred to in this act have been sold prior to July 30th, 1895, in quantities greater or less than forty acres or multiples thereof, and are in good standing as to interest payments, they may be patented in such quantities. In any cases where lands have been forfeited to the State for the non-payment of interest, the purchasers or their vendees may have their claims rein<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />stated on their written request, by paying into the treasury the full amount of interest due on such claim up to the date of reinstatement; provided, that no rights of third persons may have intervened. In all such cases the original obligations and penalties shall thereby become as binding as if no forfeiture had ever occurred.</p>
<p>Article 4218ff. When any purchaser buys and settles upon a section or part of a section of school lands, and buys, either at the same time or subsequently, other lands in addition thereto, a forfeiture for any legal cause of the part on which he resides, at any time before the three years residence thereon has been completed, shall work a forfeiture of the en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tire purchase, except such part thereof as he may have previously sold to another. But after the three years residence has been completed, a for<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />feiture of the home tract shall not of itself work a forfeiture of the other tract or tracts. In case of sale of any of said tracts before the three years residence has been completed, the vendee must reside thereon until he has completed the three years occupancy from the date of the original purchase, and a failure to do so shall subject his land to forfeiture; but in case of sale of any of said tracts after the completion of the three years residence, the vendee shall be exempt from the condition of settle<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment and occupancy.</p>
<p>Article 4218fff. Any actual, bona fide owner of and resident upon any other lands contiguous to said lands, or within a radius of five miles thereof, may also buy any of the aforesaid lands, but in such case a fail<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ure to reside upon either his other lands or upon a part of the additional lands so purchased by him, so as to make his ownership and occupancy thereof continuous for three years, shall work a forfeiture of such addi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tional lands so bought from the State, unless he shall have sold his land to another who may and does complete a three years continuous owner<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ship and occupancy of and residence upon his said lands as above stated and as is herein required of actual settlers.</p>
<p>Article 4218h. All agricultural lands belonging to the public free schools and the several asylum funds shall be sold at not less than one dollar and fifty cents per acre; and all grazing lands shall be sold at not less than one dollar per acre; and all timbered lands shall be sold at not less than five dollars per acre. By timbered lands is meant lands valuable chiefly for the timber thereon. Provided, that the owner of land which is in fact agricultural, purchased under former laws, and which land is not subject to forfeiture at the time this law goes into effect, shall not be permitted, in case said land is forfeited, to purchase said forfeited land from the State for a less price per acre that the contract price under the former sale.</p>

<p>Article 4218s.

Upon the payment of said fee, the clerk shall deliver the lease to the lessee; and no other record of leases hereafter made shall be required except said memorandum.</p>
<p>All lease contracts heretofore made and not recorded, shall be hied for record with the clerk of the proper county, within three months<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />after this act takes effect, and if aim lessee shall fail to have his unre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />corded lease so filed for record within said time, the Commissioner of the General Land Office shall disregard said lease, and award the land to any other applicant accompanying his application with the certifi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cate of the clerk that no lease of said land is of record in his office. When any of such leases are filed for record, the clerk shall make the memorandum or abstract above provided for. All lands which may be leased shall be subject to sale at any time except where otherwise pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided herein. This provision in regard to the sale of leased lands shall apply to leases heretofore made, as well as to those hereafter to be made. Any section or part of a section which may be leased, shall not be sold, nor shall the lessee be disturbed in his possession thereof during the term of his lease, in the following cases:</p>
<p>1. When the lessee has actually settled upon such section, or part of a section, and erected thereon his residence and substantial improve<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments for permanent settlement.</p>
<p>2. When he has placed on such section or part of a section improve<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments of the value of two hundred dollars.</p>
<p>3. When the aggregate of the land owned by a settler and leased by him does not exceed one section.</p>
<p>Any lands which may be leased south and west of the line herein designated shall not be sold during the term of the lease until otherwise provided by law; provided, the sections leased by any one party are not so selected as to detach sections which are thereby left unleased.

In all cases where the lease is terminated under any of the provisions of this act before the expiration of the term of lease, the lessee shall have a pro rata credit upon his next year&#8217;s rent, or the money refunded to him by the treasurer, as he may elect. On the expiration of his lease, or its termination under any pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vision of law, the lessee shall have the right for the period of sixty days to remove any or all improvements he shall have placed upon the leased premises. No purchaser or other person than the lessee shall be per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mitted to turn loose within such lessee&#8217;s inclosure more than one head of horses, mules or cattle, or in lieu thereof four head of sheep or goats, for every ten acres of land so purchased, owned or controlled by him and uninclosed. Each violation of the provisions of this act, which restrict the number of stock which may be turned loose in such inclosure, shall be an offense, and the offender, oil conviction, shall be punished by a fine of one dollar for each head of stock he may so turn loose, and each thirty days&#8217; violation of the provisions of this section shall constitute a separate offense.</p>
<p>Article 4218y.

<p>Article 586.

</opener>
<p>Whereas, the county of Loving as it now exists is in a disorganized condition, having no county officials resident within the limit of said county, and no taxes have been assessed and collected in said county for the years of 1895 and 1896, and a portion of the taxes assessed for the years of 1893 and 1894 remain uncollected, therefore</p>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That said county of Loving be and the same is hereby disorganized, and said county is hereby attached to the county of Reeves for judicial and other purposes, until such time as the said [county] shall resume an or<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ganized state.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. The County Commissioners&#8217; Court of Beeves County shall hereafter levy a sufficient annual tax, general and special, upon all prop<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />erty subject to taxation, situated in the County of Loving, to liquidate the indebtedness now existing against said county, which taxes shall be assessed and collected in the manner now provided by law for the assess<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="1260" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="206" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>ment and collection of taxes in the unorganized counties of this State; provided, also, that all taxes due the State of Texas and such as may be levied for county purposes as herein provided, upon all property situated in said county, for the present year, and for all previous years during which such taxes have not been paid, shall be assessed and collected by the officers charged by law with such duty, to the same effect as though Loving County had at all times been an [un] organized county attached to the said County of Reeves.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. The Assessor and Collector of Taxes, and the County Treas<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />urer of said County of Reeves are each hereby required to execute bonds in addition to those now given by them, in the sum of five thousand dol<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lars each, for the faithful discharge of their respective duties under this act, which bonds shall be payable to the County Judge of Reeves County and be approved by the Commissioners&#8217; Court thereof, and shall be con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ditioned as required by law for like bonds to said Reeves County, recit<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing therein that the same are given for the use of Loving County; pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided, that until bonds are given and approved, as herein required, said officers shall not assume to discharge the duties or be entitled to com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pensation for services rendered tinder this act; and provided, further, that all remedies upon and penalties for the breach or failure to give similar bonds under the laws of this State shall apply to said officers re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />spectively.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. After giving bond as herein required, the said Assessor, Col<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lector and Treasurer shall be held to the discharge of their duties under the law, and be entitled to receive compensation for their services by way of commissions, to the same effect and subject to the same limitations provided by law, as though said officers were acting for Loving County alone, and said officers shall make separate reports and settlements with the State, and with said Commissioners&#8217; Court, on account of Loving County, to the same effect as now required by law of each of them in the discharge of their duties as officers of Reeves County, and shall be liable to all penalties provided by law for failure to make such reports and settlements; provided, however, that the Treasurer of said Reeves County shall not be the custodian of moneys collected to pay the interest and sinking fund upon the bonded indebtedness of said Loving County, but shall be entitled to his lawful commissions thereon, nor shall be be required to give bond under this act, after all other debts known to exist against said county, have been paid; and should any funds remain in his hands after payment of all known indebtedness against said county, he shall pay the same over to the State Treasurer, to be used in liquidating the bonded indebtedness of said county; and provided, further, that after all known debts against Loving County have been paid, outside of its bonded indebtedness, the amount of the additional bonds, to be given by the assessor, and collector of taxes, shall be fixed by the Commissioners&#8217; Court of said Reeves County, in any sum not less than double the amount of taxes to be collected upon said bonded indebtedness during the term of such official bonds.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. All moneys collected by the collector of taxes of Reeves County to pay interest and provide the sinking fund upon the bonded indebtedness of Loving County, shall be reported, accounted for, and paid to the Treasurer of the. State of Texas in the same manner required by law upon taxes due the State, and such moneys shall be received and<pb n="1261" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="207" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>paid out by the State Treasurer upon such bonded indebtedness, accord<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing to the terms thereof; provided, that the option retained to Loving County to pay said bonds before the maturity thereof may be exercised by the Commissioners&#8217; Court of Reeves County, and, with the consent of the holder or holders of any of said bonds, the same may be paid at any time, and provisions made therefor by the levy and collection of the full amount of special tax authorized by law for such purposes.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. That immediately upon the taking effect of this act, the funds now in the State Treasury to the credit of said Loving County, held by the State and apportioned or belonging to said Loving County, shall be paid over to the treasurer of Reeves County, to be held by him for the payment of Loving County&#8217;s indebtedness as herein provided.</p>
<p>Sec. 7. That the several officers of Reeves County who are the proper custodians of the several books, papers, accounts, or other property of Reeves County, shall likewise be the proper custodians of such books, papers, accounts, or other property of Loving County, and the commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioners of Reeves County are hereby authorized and empowered to take the proper steps for the removal of such valuable property to the county seat of Reeves County to be delivered to the proper custodians thereof, and shall take all necessary steps by suit in the name of Loving County to recover back to said county all lands and other property properly be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />longing to it, which may have been wrongfully converted or disposed of by any person assuming to act for said county or otherwise; and the ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />penses thereof to be paid out of the first general revenue funds collected from the territory embraced by Loving County; and certified copies of all such books, documents, papers, or other matter, including certified copies of deeds, mortgages, deeds of trust, or other muniments of title to real estate or to personal property, given under the hand and seal of the proper officer of Reeves County shall have all the force and effect, and be admissible in evidence, in the same manner, and as fully as if the same had been given by the proper officer of Loving County.</p>
<p>Sec. 8. That the county judge of Reeves County shall, immediately after this act goes into effect, publish in some newspaper, published in Reeves County, if one be there published, and if not, then in some news<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />paper published in some adjoining county to Reeves County, a notice to all persons holding any claim or indebtedness against Loving County to present the same to the commissioners of Reeves County for approval or rejection, on or before the first day of December, 1897.</p>
<p>Sec. 9. That all parties now having any claims against or warrant or bond or indebtedness of Loving County shall on or before the first day of December, 1897, present the claim or indebtedness to the com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioners&#8217; court of Reeves County for rejection or approval, and the commissioners&#8217; court of Reeves County shall pass on all such claims, warrants, bonds, and indebtedness in the same manner and order as if they were the commissioners of Loving County, approving or rejecting the same in all respects as claims and debentures are now required to be presented for approval or rejection to commissioners&#8217; court.</p>
<p>Sec. 10. That whenever any claim or indebtedness above named shall have been rejected by the commissioners of Reeves County, the owners thereof may have all legal remedies in Reeves County, as fully as if the claim or indebtedness were against Reeves County, the judgment, order<pb n="1262" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="208" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>or decree, to be against the assets of Loving County only, and to be paid by the proper funds realized upon the property of Loving County.</p>
<p>Sec. 11. That all existing indebtedness or claims against Loving County which have not been barred for more than two years after this act shall take effect, may be presented to the commissioners&#8217; court of Reeves County, on or before the first day of December, 1897, for a rejec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion or approval, and shall be passed upon by said commissioners&#8217; court in all respects as if presented at any time not earlier than two years prior to the time of presentation.</p>
<p>Sec. 12. That the commissioners&#8217; court of Reeves County, after the aforesaid claims have been filed with and approved by them as above provided, shall classify them as provided by law, and they shall levy a sufficient general and special tax as hereinbefore named, not to exceed the limit allowed by law, for each year, to pay all the indebtedness of each class so registered and approved by them, including the expenses authorized by this act; and where legal bonds have been issued to create a sinking fund, keeping each class and the funds belonging to it sep<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />arate and distinct from every other fund, and out of each fund to pay the claims against such fund only. Where claims filed with and ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />proved by the commissioners&#8217; court of Loving County are also filed with and approved by the commissioners&#8217; court of Reeves County, they shall be paid in the order registered by and approved in Loving County; pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided, they are filed on or before December the 1st, 1897; otherwise, they shall be paid in the order registered by and approved by the Reeves County commissioners.</p>
<p>Sec. 13. All laws and parts of laws in conflict with the provisions of this act are hereby repealed.</p>
<p>Sec. 14. The fact that there can be no taxes assessed or collected, and no court either criminal or civil held in Loving County-under the exist<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing condition of affairs, creates an emergency and an imperative public necessity that the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days be suspended, and that this act take effect from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>

<p>Sec. 2. The Commissioners Court of said county shall have full power and authority, and it shall be its duty, to adopt such a system for work<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing, laying out, draining, and repairing the public roads in said county as it may deem best, and from time to time said court may change its plan or system of working. Said Commissioners Court shall have full power to purchase such teams, tools and machinery as may be necessary for the working of its roads. Said court shall have power to construct, grade, or otherwise improve any road or bridge by contract. In such case said court or county Judge of said county, may advertise in such manner as said court may determine, for bids to do such work, and the contract shall be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder, who shall enter into bond, payable to the county judge of said county for the use of the road and bridge fund, with good and sufficient sureties, to be ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />proved by said court, and in such sums as said court may determine, for the faithful compliance with the terms of said contract, but said court shall have the right to reject any and all bids. At the time of making such contract, the court shall direct the county treasurer to pass the amounts to a particular fund for that purpose, and the treasurer shall keep a separate account of such funds; same shall not be used for any other purpose, and can only be paid out on the order of said court; and the said court shall have authority to employ any hands or teams to work on the roads, under such regulations and for such price as they may deem best, not to exceed two dollars and fifty cents per day, of ten hours per day, for a team and driver, and not to exceed one dollar and twenty-five cents per day for day hands; and no road hand when work<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing out his time on the road shall be required to work but eight hours per day; but when hands are hired by the day, they shall be required to work ten hours per day.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. The Commissioners Court of said county shall require all county convicts not otherwise employed, to labor upon the public roads under such regulations as they may prescribe, and each convict so worked shall receive a credit of fifty cents, on his fine first, and then on the cost, for each day he may labor. The Commissioners Court may provide such reasonable regulations, as punishments, as may be necessary to require such convicts to perform good work; and may provide a re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ward, not to exceed ten dollars, to be paid out of the road and bridge fund, for the recapture and delivery of any escaped convict, to be paid to any person other than the guard or person in charge of such convict at the time of his escape.

The aforesaid amounts shall be paid out of the road and bridge fund, upon the order of said court, when said fine and costs have been worked out as provided in this section; provided, that this act shall not be construed so as to relieve any convict from payment of all costs for which he would be liable under the general laws of this State.</p>
<p>Nothing in this section shall be construed so as to deprive the Com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioners Court of the right to have convicts to work a part or all of their time on the county convict farm; but authority is herein expressly given said court to require convicts to labor, in payment of fines and costs, either upon the county convict farm or upon the public roads, or partly upon both, as to said court it may seem best, and the provisions of this section shall apply as far as practicable, in all cases where con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />victs labor upon the county convict farm.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. Each county commissioner shall have charge of all road over<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />seers in his district and shall deliver to each of them, all teams, tools and machinery necessary in working the roads in the district of said over<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />seer, so far as he has been supplied therewith by the Commissioners Court, taking receipt of said overseer therefor, specifying each item and giving its value, which receipt shall be a full answer of the liability of the commissioner and shall fix the liability of the overseer. And any commissioner or overseer who shall have been entrusted with any teams, tools or machinery belonging to said county, shall be liable for any damages that may occur to the same while in his possession caused by negligence or want of due care of same, and shall not use or permit the same to be used for private purposes without the consent of the Com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioners Court.

<p>Sec. 6.

<p>Sec. 15. In all cases where the cost of material and labor exceeds two hundred dollars, it shall be the duty of said court to construct, grade, or gravel, or otherwise improve any road or bridge by contract, the same to be advertised for as provided by said Commissioners Court.</p>

Such superintendent, when elected or appointed, shall perform the duties of his office from time to time, under such direction or regulations as in the judgment of the Commissioners Court may seem best; and said superintendent shall at all times be subject to the direc<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion or immediate control of the Commissioners Court Such county superintendent of public roads and highways, before entering upon the discharge of his duties, shall take the oath of office prescribed by law, and shall enter into bond in the sum of five thousand dollars, with good and sufficient sureties, to be approved by the County Commissioners Court, and to be filed with the county clerk of Parker County, and said bond shall be made payable to the County Commissioners Court of Par<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ker County and their successors in office, in trust for the road and bridge fund of Parker County, and be conditioned for the faithful perform<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ance of the duties of his office. In case said bond is forfeited and col<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lected, the sum so collected shall become a part of the road and bridge fund of Parker County. Such superintendent, while actually engaged in the discharge of the duties of his office, shall receive from the road and bridge fund of Parker County, as compensation for his services, a salary not exceeding six hundred dollars per year; and the County Com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioners&#8217; Court of Parker County shall have the power and authority, when in their judgment they may deem it advisable, to abolish the office of county superintendent of public roads and highways, by an order en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tered on the minutes of their court at a regular term thereof.

<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That Section 1 of an act entitled An act to authorize and permit the Aransas Pass Harbor Company to purchase from the State of Texas, Harbor Island, certain shoal waters and flats in front thereof, and in Red Fish Bay, and to excavate a free channel along and through Turtle Cove, between Corpus Christi Bay and the deep water harbor or channel at or near Aransas Pass, in order to encourage the procuring and main<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tenance of deep water at Aransas Pass, and prescribing certain condi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions attaching to and following such purchase, passed at the present session, and which became a law without the Governor&#8217;s approval, April 8th, A. D. 1897, be so amended as to hereafter read as follows:</p>
<p>Section 1. The Aransas Pass Harbor Company shall be permitted to purchase from the State of Texas, at two dollars per acre, all or any portion of Harbor Island, situated near Aransas Pass, on the Gulf coast of Texas, as well as the shoal waters and flats lying in front of said island on its east side out to the present deep [water] channel; and also all and any flats and shoal waters in Red Fish Bay, lying in one-half mile of any deep water channel, navigable for sea-going boats, that may be hereafter constructed by said company through or in said Red Fish Bay connecting the same with Aransas or Corpus Christi Bays, or the Morris and Cummins channel, and extending to the shore of Red Fish Bay at and near the present town site of Aransas Pass; and provided, further, that any channel so constructed in Red Fish Bay, shall be sixty feet wide at the bottom and five feet deep throughout; and provided, further, that said company shall not be permitted to purchase any flats or shoal waters in Red Fish Bay lying within one-half mile of any private holdings on said Red Fish Bay on the side next to the present town site of Aransas Pass; and provided, further, that all channels excavated or constructed by said Aransas Pass Harbor Company, under the authority of this law, shall forever remain open and free to all vessels without fee or charge; pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided, that said company shall not be permitted to purchase the twenty<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="1288" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="234" /><fw type="header" place="top">General Laws of Texas.</fw>five acres of Harbor Island heretofore patented to the United States, and on which Aransas lighthouse now stands, nor the shoal waters or flats in front thereof, nor the land on which the State quarantine station is now situated on said island, nor the shoal waters or flats in front thereof, which said land is hereby specially reserved to the State, and which said land so reserved is described as follows: Beginning at a point situ<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ated at mean low tide mark on the east shore of said Harbor Island, one-half mile in a northerly direction from the center of the foot or shore end of the quarantine wharf; thence in a southerly direction along the east shore of said island at mean low tide mark, with its meanders, one mile to the southeast corner of this tract of land; thence in a west<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />erly course in right angles with the general course of the line above es<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tablished, one-half mile establish corner for southwest corner of this tract; thence in a northerly direction parallel with the general course of the east line of this tract, as herein first above provided; one mile es<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tablish the northwest corner of this tract; thence in an easterly direction parallel with the south line of this tract, one-half mile to point of be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ginning on east shore of Harbor Island for northeast corner; provided, however, that if said described property is abandoned by the State as a quarantine station and hereafter put upon the market for sale or lease by the State, said harbor company shall have the preference right to buy or lease same at the price that may hereafter be put thereon by the State; provided, however, that such preference shall continue for ninety days only after the time said property is put on the market by the State for such sale or lease; provided, further, that said company shall not be permitted to purchase or acquire under this act the shallow bay or cove locally known as Turtle Cove, and situated between Harbor Is<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />land on the north and northwest and Corpus Christi Bay on the west side, and Mustang Island on the south and southeast, and Aransas Pass and Aransas Bay on the east and northeast; provided, further, that said company shall not purchase or acquire any of the shoal waters or flats adjoining what is known as Shell Bank Island, Talley Island, and the shell reef running towards the main land from said island.

<p>Sec. 2.
